It was almost all photographs. The photographs told the step-by-step story of how his company cleaned up a site in Canada. There were pictures of people doing tests and even a humorous PPT of waste flying away across the sky. Diane’s presentation consisted of professionally-designed PPTs. The PPTs had written information about successful projects, technical information. Diane also used humour in her presentation. She told a story about how her company learned from a past mistake. After her presentation, not many people came to talk to Diane. She noticed, however, that a lot of people were talking to Andy after his.
