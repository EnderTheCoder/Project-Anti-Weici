In 1869, John James Sainsbury and his wife opened a small shop selling fresh milk, butter and eggs in London. Other products like meat and vegetables weren’t introduced until later. The shop became well known because, in spite of the food being of higher quality than that at other shops, the prices were not higher. Working conditions in nineteenth-century shops would seem hard to us but Sainsbury’s workers were well looked after. In return, they had to work long hours. In fact, Saturday evening was often the busiest time. After closing, the shop had to be cleaned and tidied and it could be after 2 a.m. before the workers were able to leave. By the 1920s, the design of many of the shops had changed and a typical Sainsbury’s shop had six departments offering a much wider range of products than other food shops. Each shop offered home delivery throughout the surrounding area. This service came to an end during the 1960s as people had their own transport but has become popular again with the 21st century since people started ordering their food on the Internet and having it delivered. In 1974, Sainsbury’s first out-of-town supermarket opened on the edge of Cambridge and today most towns in Britain have a Sainsbury’s nearby.</p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":8291,\"main_id\":53947,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What do we know about the workers in Sainsbury’s?\\n\\n\",\"answer\":\"A.
