Mr. Baggins, I’m calling because you got in touch with us and asked us to get a bike from Holland for you. Well, it’s going to arrive next Monday, but I have to check it, so you can come and get it next Tuesday. I know you wanted a red one, but they haven’t got any in that colour. Sorry! So they’re sending a silver one of the same style instead. Hope that’s OK? This colour looks not bad.</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">You’ll be pleased because this bike is a bit cheaper. It was one hundred and eighty-five dollars, but now it’s only one hundred and sixty. It’s worth every penny of it.</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">Remember, don’t come to the shop at No. 33 North Street. We’re a hundred metres down the street at No. 87, opposite the supermarket. We only repair bikes at No. 33. And please don’t come at lunchtime if possible, because we are very busy then. We’re open every day until 5:45 p.m. And I’m here every morning from 8:30.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">By the way, would you like to know the bill in advance? If you would like us to e-mail a copy of your bill, please give us a call at 999-5783 during our working time. We look forward to seeing you soon in the City Bike Shop!

You know we’ve been asked to organize a party for Tony’s birthday.</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">W: Of course. Let’s start working out the details. The first thing is, er, the time. Tony’s birthday …</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">M: October 25th?</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">W: Sure! And what about the place?</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">M: Is the dining hall a good choice? Or a club is much better?</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">W: I think Tony likes a quiet place.</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">M: How about the newly opened café?</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">W: Sounds great! Then we’d better make sure how many people will be invited to the party.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">M: Yeah, I’ve been working it out and I think 9 including Tony.</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">W: OK. Next thing … yes … the birthday gift. Do you have any ideas?</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">M: You know Tony loves music, so I thought perhaps, an MP3.</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">W: That’s a good idea. I’ll check the price through the Internet later.</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">M: Great! I’ll call the café right now to book a table.</p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"}]","chinese":"","delete":0,"image_content":"[{\"id\":0,\"pid\":-1,\"text\":\"网络图\",\"show_text\":\"网络图\"}]","answer_e":"","answer_f":"","answer_g":"","answer_h":"","subject_edit":""},{"id":54183,"word_id":0,"test_group":2,"check_point":2,"questions":0,"subject":"高一试题20 - Text 9_AAC.aac","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":8500,\"main_id\":54183,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What are the speakers doing?\",\"answer\":\"A.
