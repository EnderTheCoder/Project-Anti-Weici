题目:        It was nearly dinner time when my 5-year-old daughter burst into the house. Tears rolled down as she ### her two hurt arms. I tried to persuade her to ### , as that was the fourth time she had crashed that day. I told her that children of her ### usually rode with training wheels. She ### my advice and as soon as the bandages (绷带) were stuck on her ### , she headed back out the door.
        I watched from the kitchen window as she ### time after time. I wanted to run out there and make her stop, but I couldn’t. I would have to let go. ### , she had agreed to wear her brother’s helmet (头盔) and knee pads (护膝).
        Finally, when I couldn’t ### watching there another second, I went outside to see if I could help. I ran behind the ### , holding it by the back of her seat. She ### back at me, “Mommy, I got it. Let go!” I remembered when I ### learned to ride a two-wheeler at her age. I remembered how I knew I could do it if I just kept ### . Suddenly I understood why she would ### give up.       
        Later that very evening, as I washed the remaining dishes, I heard my daughter shout ### for me. I rushed outside and sighed with ### to see that she was riding down the driveway with both her ### held high in the air. “Look, Mom, no hands!” she said, ### as she rode by.  
        I suppose there will be many times to ### when my daughter will need me to simply ### . Although it won’t be ### , I’ll always remember how she taught me that sometimes “no hands” is best.
