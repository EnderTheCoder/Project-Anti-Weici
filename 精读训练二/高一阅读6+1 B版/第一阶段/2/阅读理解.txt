I am a dog lover and have saved all of my dogs from either death row or from people who were going to put them down. Everyone should have a chance to live and Bark stresses that with its articles. This magazine is a MUST HAVE for any dog lover!!Dog Fancy Cover price: $54.00 Price: $14.99 ($1.25 / issue)You save: $39.01 (72%) Review: By Berner Mom Don’t waste your money on this magazine. 60-70 percent of it are advertisements, and the articles offer little useful information. It might be suitable for children, but not adults who are serious about educating themselves about dogs.Dog WorldCover price: $ 48.88 Price: $ 14.99 ($1.25 / issue)You save: $ 33.89 (69%) Review: By one criticDog World has many very interesting and thought-provoking (令人思考的) articles for people involved in dog showing, breeding (饲养), performance events, etc. However, over half of the magazine is devoted to breeder ads, which is boring. Still, as a whole, I recommend (推荐) it for the articles. Good articles, but tons of ads.Modern Dog Cover price: $ 45.00 Price: $ 15.00 ($3.75 / issue)You save: $30.00 (66%) Review: By DinahMy new favorite magazine! Beautiful photos, smart and interesting articles, fashion, art, interviews with famous people … all with a dog focus! Cover models range from Paris Hilton and Tinkerbell to Virginia Madsen and her dogs. Thanks to Modern Dog I now know how to give a dog-friendly cocktail party and how to actually get my dog to come when she’s called. Surely worth checking out.
