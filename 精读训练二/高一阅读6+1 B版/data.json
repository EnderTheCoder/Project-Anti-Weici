       Bethany Hamilton is from Hawaii. When she was just 13 years old, she and her friend were surfing in the ocean. While they were surfing, a shark attacked Hamilton. In the attack, Hamilton lost her left arm.        Hamilton was rushed to the hospital. When she got to the hospital, she had already lost more than half of her blood. She almost died, but doctors saved her life.        Hamilton loved surfing, and she didn’t want to stop. Of course, now it was much harder for her, because she only had one arm. First, she got a special surfboard. This board was thicker, and it was easier to control. Then, she started to exercise her legs. She needed stronger legs because she had to kick more to push the board through the water. Finally, she learned how to surf with only one arm. Less than one month after Hamilton lost her arm, she was surfing again.        Today, Hamilton is a professional surfer. She surfs in competitions around the world. She has been in competitions in the USA, Brazil, and Australia. In total, she has won four major competitions. She no longer needs a special surfboard.

First is a tropical disturbance (热带扰动), which has thunderstorms and rotating (旋转) winds. Next is a tropical depression (热带低气压), which is similar to a tropical disturbance, but has winds between 23 and 39 miles per hour. A tropical storm is the next level, which has stronger wind speeds between 40 and 73 miles per hour. Once winds reach 74 miles per hour, the storm is officially called a hurricane. The wind picks up energy from the warm surface ocean water.        As a hurricane crosses over land, it begins to become weaker or break apart and reduce in strength. This is because it is no longer over the warm ocean water that it needs for energy. At this point, a hurricane can still cause a lot of damage because of high winds, rain, and flooding, but unless it makes its way back over the open ocean, it is downgraded from a hurricane back to a tropical storm.

This superheated material known as lava (熔岩) flows  like toothpaste. Stretching (延伸) and erupting, the earth slowly builds a new island.        Along the Pacific coast of South America, one part of the planet’s surface  gradually moves toward another. Although difficult to believe, the rocky outer  surface of Earth is not solid; rather, it is broken up into huge pieces called plates. Up to 250 miles thick, the plates, which float on top of a softer layer (层) of hot rock, move at a pace of  0.39 to 3.94 inches per year. As the plates slide past one another, the action can sometimes  result in volcanic activity.        These events take place thousands of miles apart, yet they are connected. Surrounding the  Pacific Ocean is a circle of volcanoes that includes more than half of the world’s active  volcanoes. This region is called the Ring of Fire.        The Ring of Fire stretches from the west coast of South America northward to Alaska. It  curves (成曲线形) left at the Aleutian Islands and crosses the Pacific Ocean.

The third explosion was so loud that it could be clearly heard 3,000 miles away.  Krakatoa threw a large dust cloud nearly 50 miles into the air. For a year, that cloud shrouded Earth and changed the weather worldwide.        Closer to home, Mount St. Helens, a volcano in the Cascade Range in Washington, erupted in  1980. No lava flew from Mount St. Helens. But the ash was thick enough to affect travel. The side  of the mountain fell away, causing a landslide.        In 1991 Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted after 600 quiet years. During four days in  June, Pinatubo released more than 20 million tons of dust into the air, destroying many homes.        Some volcanoes erupt more quietly, with lava flowing through the cracks in Earth’s surface.  This type of volcano is found in Hawaii. Lava from a volcano, such as Kilauea, advances slowly  but still causes great damage.

Or maybe you miss every free throw during your basketball game — and to top it off, you are not friendly to your teammate on the way to the locker room.\n        These may seem like unrelated events, but here’s the surprising truth: Each may be a direct consequence of your lack of sleep time. In one study, just an hour less of sleep each night made six-graders perform like fourth-graders on mental tests. Other research shows that sleep loss makes you run slower and miss more shots in sports, while doubling your possibility of injury.\n        Some experts even argue that teens would be less likely to take risks or suffer from anxiety (焦虑) and depression (沮丧) if they could just get enough sleep.\n        “When you lack sleep and you run into a stressful situation, whether it’s with your friends or something else, you’re going to get angry and upset,” explains Dr. Kathleen Berchelmann, a doctor in St. Louis, Missouri. “I see a lot of depression and anxiety in teens who aren’t getting enough sleep.”\n        It’s surprising to think that by spending more time in bed, you could lift your grade point average, get along with your loved ones, perform better on the field, and feel happier.
