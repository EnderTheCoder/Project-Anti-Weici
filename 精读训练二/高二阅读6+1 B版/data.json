     At the end of the fifteenth century, Western explorers began looking for the Northwest Passage — a water route through the Arctic that is north of the Canadian mainland and connects the Atlantic

They are really fat and they have short, thick legs. They also have little round ears that wiggle (摆动) sometimes.    Hippos look funny, but you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. Hippos are extremely violent and dangerous. In fact, they kill more people than any other animal in Africa. Think of how many dangerous animals that Africa has. It has got crocodiles, snakes, lions, elephants, and many more. Hippos are more dangerous than all of them.    Hippos are naturally very dangerous animals, but there are some situations that make them even more dangerous than normal. They are very territorial. That means that they stay in one area which they consider to be their private area. If a person or animal enters a hippo’s area, the hippo will attack. Hippos also often attack when they are returning to the water. Hippos eat on land and return to the water at dusk. If a hippo sees an animal when it’s returning to the water, it will become violent.    Hippos are so strong that they often kill crocodiles. There are two reasons that explain why hippos and crocodiles often fight. First of all, hippos and crocodiles live in the same areas. Since hippos are territorial, they don’t like having crocodiles nearby. Also, crocodiles often eat young hippos. For that reason, adult hippos frequently kill crocodiles.    Mother and daughter hippos have close relationships. However, hippos don’t have any other close relationship with each other. Hippos often live together in large groups, but scientists don’t know why. It’s hard to study the behavior of male and female hippos, because males and females look the same.    Hippos are violent, but they are herbivores. A herbivore is an animal that eats only plants. An adult hippo eats about 50 kilograms of plants every day. Hippos are much more comfortable in the water, but they can run fast on land. Their top speed is about 19 kilometers per hour. That’s much faster than humans can run.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p>本文是一篇说明文。文章介绍了非洲最危险凶猛的动物——河马，包括河马会变得更凶猛的原因、与鳄鱼打仗的原因以及喜欢群居等生活习性。</p>","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":7863,\"main_id\":52363,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What is the text mainly about?\",\"answer\":\"C.

They are really fat and they have short, thick</span>&nbsp;legs. They also have little round ears that wiggle (摆动<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">) sometimes.</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hippos look funny, but you shouldn’<span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;\">t judge a book by its cover. Hippos are extremely violent and dangerous. In</span>&nbsp;fact, they kill more people than any other animal in Africa. Think of how many dangerous animals that Africa has. It&nbsp;has got crocodiles, snakes, lions, elephants, and many more. Hippos are more dangerous than all of them.</span></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hippos are naturally very dangerous animals, but there are some situations that make them even more dangerous&nbsp;than normal. They are very territorial. That means that they stay in one area which they consider to be their private&nbsp;area. If a person or animal enters a hippo’<span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;\">s area, the hippo will attack. Hippos also often attack when they are returning</span>&nbsp;to the water. Hippos eat on land and return to the water at dusk. If a hippo sees an animal when it’<span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;\">s returning to the <span style=\"font-family: 宋体; font-size: 10.5pt;\">water, it will become violent.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hippos are so strong that they often kill crocodiles. There are two reasons that explain why hippos and crocodiles&nbsp;often fight. First of all, hippos and crocodiles live in the same areas. Since hippos are territorial, they don’<span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;\">t like having</span>&nbsp;crocodiles nearby. Also, crocodiles often eat young hippos. For that reason, adult hippos frequently kill crocodiles.</span></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother and daughter hippos have close relationships.

Hippos often live together in large groups, but scientists don’<span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;\">t know why.
