题目:        In 1972, when my family moved into a house in Plainedge, some small unpleasantness gradually developed with our next-door neighbors. It was small, but was enough to create icy tension that lasted for ###.
        The ### was that we wanted our neighbors to trim (修剪) our side of their thick 6-foot high hedges (树篱) on the border. The neighbors did so once, but not after that. A few unfriendly words were ###, but mostly we ignored each other.
        About 10 years later, the neighbors, Bob and Pat Yurasits, removed the hedges and put up a 4-foot high chain- link fence. We wanted ### privacy, so my husband put up a 6-foot high fence parallel to their fence. Our fence was eyesore (碍眼), and it was a ### decision on our part. Years passed. The ### between the two houses remained.
        After our children grew up in the early 2000s, and life was less busy, we began ### each other with waves, nods and hellos. Then on Oct. 29, 2012, a superstorm hit Long Island ###. Trees and wires were down everywhere, and our neighborhood lost electricity for nearly two weeks.
        We learned that the Yurasits’ adult son, Louis, who has ### need, uses an electrically adjustable bed. When the power ###, the bed was stuck in the upright position. Without electricity, they could not ### it to a flat position. Louis had to sleep in a sitting position.
        ###, we were using a machine to produce electricity. When we heard about Louis’###, my husband ran an extension cord (电线) from our backyard, over the two ### and through the neighbors’ window. The bed was adjusted and the immediate crisis was prevented.
        Pat and Bob insisted on ### us for the electricity. We refused. It made us feel good to ### our neighbors. It was a terrible time, but we all ### it — and we became much ###.
        I ### the years wasted, but somehow what we share now has a deeper significance. Lately, our ugly fence had begun to lean on their shorter fence; we had it ###. It was our Berlin Wall finally falling down.
