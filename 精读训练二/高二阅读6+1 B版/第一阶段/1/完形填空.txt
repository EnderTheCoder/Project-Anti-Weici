题目:        My grandmother Abuelita and I were sitting on the balcony on one hot, sunny summer morning. She had just made lemonade the ### only she can, not too sweet. Lots of ice and a thin yellow slice of real lemon ### in each of our glasses. We closed our eyes and took a long drink. “Let it ### you as it flows down to your toes,” she said. She’d only been here for six months after ### Mexico City.
        “I love to wiggle (扭动) my toes in the sand at the beach and feel the ### come up over them,” I said after finishing half of my lemonade in one ### drink.
        “Oh, have you been there?” Abuelita asked. I was ### to learn she had never seen the ocean. I thought everyone in Mexico and California had been to the ### ! It was time to take her there. Abuelita should also ### the beautiful beach.
        The next day was Saturday, and we all got into our car: Abuelita, my older brother, and me. It took about an hour and a half to get there, which is ### we don’t go very often. When we do go through, we have so much ### .
        No amount of fun could compare, though, to the ### in Abuelita’s eyes when she saw that infinite (无穷的) field of blue that is the Pacific Ocean. Tears filled her eyes, and she couldn’t even find the ### to say how she was feeling, in either English or Spanish.
        We spread out our blankets, towels, umbrella, and all the other ### that people take to the beach. We had a big bottle full of Abuelita’s ice-cold lemonade. It tasted ### better than the day before. I even ### Abuelita to go into the water with me, beginning of course with our ### wiggling in the sand. ### cooling off from the head down, we cooled ourselves from our toes up as we ### the reflecting splash (飞溅声) of waves that reached out to ### us.
