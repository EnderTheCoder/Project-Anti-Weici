Apparently many college students would have no problem with that. They believe students are owed a good grade simply because they put a lot of effort into a class. Or at least that is what they told researchers last year at the University of California, Irvine.         The researchers asked over 800 college students if they agreed or disagreed with some statements. For example, “If I have completed most of the reading for a class, I deserve a B in that course.” And, “A professor should not be annoyed with me if I receive an important call during class.”         Just 16% thought that it was OK to take that phone call. But 66% agreed that a professor should consider effort and not just the quality of a student’s work when deciding grades. And 40% thought they should get a B, the second highest mark, just because they did most of the reading for class.         The findings appeared in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence.

At present there are about 2.5 million nurses working in the field and a half million more are expected to be added soon. Nursing salaries average about $66,000 per year, but they can go up to over $140,000 with higher education and specialized field training.Nursing also provides the benefit of flexible time, allowing you to choose when you want to work.        Engineering is one of the hottest and most stably growing careers in the country. There is plenty of opportunity for advancement and income growth in this field. Starting salaries for engineers is higher than most other jobs because a college degree is required. There are also many different fields of specialization to choose from as an engineer.Average salaries are around $72,000, but can quickly be more than $120,000 with experience and position.        Online marketing is a field that is fairly new to the career market and there is exciting growth potential. It offers a lot of flexibility with many different specialized areas. The average salary for online marketers is $53,000 per year, but some who work in specialized areas make over $200,000.

Some people wore it around their necks, too. Even today, people still string popcorn as a decoration during the winter holidays.        Today we cook popcorn in many ways. We can put it in a pot with oil. We can put bags of popcorn in the microwave oven. There are even poppers that blow hot air to cook the corn.        Many years ago, people of the Americas cooked popcorn in different ways, too.They would throw the corn into the fire. When the corn heated, the cooked kernels (粒) would fly out. Sometimes people would just throw kernels into the fire. When the popcorn popped, they would pick up the cooked popcorn from all around the fire. Another way to cook popcorn was to put it in a pot with sand, instead of with the oil we would use today. The popcorn would jump to the top of the sand when it popped.        When settlers came to America, they found a new way to eat popcorn: with milk poured over it, just like you eat cereal (谷类早餐食品). Now we like to eat popcorn with butter and salt.        The Science of Popcorn        No matter how you eat it, popcorn is fun. The real question is: what makes it pop?        When you look at those tiny kernels of popcorn, they look dry. But popcorn kernels are all wet on the inside.Inside each kernel is a tiny drop of water. When the kernel is heated, the water heats up, too. The drop of water heats up and turns to steam. This is when the fun begins. Steam takes up more space than water. As steam fills the inside of the kernel, the corn inside starts to puff up (膨胀). There is no room in the tiny kernel. The inside of the kernel gets bigger and bigger. The hard shell of the kernel pops wide open. The kernel turns inside out, and the popcorn is ready to eat.        This just goes to show that the popcorn can be many things. It is a decoration and a fun food that is fun to eat, and it is a way to learn about science, too.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p>本文是一篇说明文，介绍了爆米花的历史和有关它的科学小知识。</p>","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":7989,\"main_id\":53731,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Popcorn “poppers” are most likely ________.\",\"answer\":\"C. machines that pop the corn kernels\",\"answer_a\":\"A. kernels of corn that do not pop\",\"answer_b\":\"B. people who pop the corn kernels\",\"answer_c\":\"C. machines that pop the corn kernels\",\"answer_d\":\"D. bags of corn kernels that pop in the microwave\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p>词义猜测题 根据上文中pot和microwave oven以及下文的blow hot air to cook the corn可看出poppers很可能是一种制作爆米花的机器。</p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":7990,\"main_id\":53731,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What is paragraph 3 about?\",\"answer\":\"A.
