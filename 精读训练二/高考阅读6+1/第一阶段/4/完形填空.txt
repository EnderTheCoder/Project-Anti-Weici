题目:        Ellen Glanz lied to her teacher about why she hadn’t done her homework, but, of course, many students have lied to their teachers. The ### is that Ellen Glanz was a 28-year-old high school teacher who was a student for six months to ### her teaching by gaining a fresh perspective (视角) of her school.
        She found many classes ###, students doing as little as necessary to pass tests. She concluded that many students have little power and ### for their own education.
        Ellen Glanz found herself doing the ### things. There was the day when Glanz wanted to join her friend’s party to ### the purchase of a new house, but she had ### for a math class. For the first time, she knew how students feel when they think something is more ### than homework.
        She found a way out and told the ###, “I considered my choices: admit ### to the teacher, copy someone else’s sheet, or make up an excuse.” She chose the ### one — the one most widely ### — and told the teacher that the ### needed to complete the homework had been ripped (撕掉) from the book. The teacher accepted her story, never ### her book. In fact, nobody else did the homework.
      “Finally,” Glanz said, “the teacher, thinking that the homework must have been difficult, ### each question at the blackboard while students copied the ### at their seats. The teacher had ### the material and the students had listened to the explanation. But had anything been ###? I don’t think so.” Glanz found these things were ### in many classes. Students simply didn’t do the homework, but copied from someone else or ### the teacher to do the work for them.
