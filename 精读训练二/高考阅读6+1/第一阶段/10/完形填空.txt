题目:        I’m an American who has lived in France for nearly 20 years. I’ve complained with other Americans about how the French are ### for friendship. I’ve had a ### time making a living here.
        Three years ago, I moved to a new neighborhood and felt a strong ### to meet people so I went to the cinema night for Women’s Day. I was ### about the possibility of finding a way to connect to French women through the ### we would have after the film, perhaps to make friends and get more work.
        Outside the cinema was a woman with long gray hair asking for money. I ### my wallet to give her a Euro and then something made me ### and enter into conversation with her. I said, “Look, all the women going to the cinema here on a Tuesday night are seeing a film that could ### our life. I’d rather buy you a ### than give you money.”
        So she came in, ### behind me because she said the people running the cinema didn’t like her. She sat next to me. Then I ### some women were looking at me ###.
        I ### the woman to come the following night to an event. I directed her to a(n) ### that helped women in her situation. Then, a woman came toward me and said, “Are you the person who ### a ticket for the woman outside the cinema asking for handouts (救济品)?” When I said yes she said, “I want you to come to the community (社 区) center where I work. Could you please ### other employees there?”
        This was the ### of a deep friendship and colleague relationship. The woman I took to the cinema that night isn’t ### any longer and she now is a secretary. ### reaching out to her I make many great friends, have a great job, and ### myself of many judgments about the French.
