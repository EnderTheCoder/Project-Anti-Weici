题目:Singapore Swimming Lessons        My son was a water phobic (恐惧症患者) but he recently won the swimming competition held by his school! Three years ago, my family and I were invited to a house warming party. My son, who didn’t know how to swim, accidentally fell into the swimming pool while he was playing with other kids around the pool side area. He looked at me and shouted for help continuously, scared to death. I felt so helpless as I wasn’t able to swim as well. I decided to sign my son as well as myself up for private swimming lesson through Happy Fish Swim School. The instructor was patient and friendly and helped my son overcome his phobic of water. Now, my entire family is able to swim and we still head to the pool every week!From: Mrs Cheng (Bedok, Singapore)Our Swimming Instructor        Our swimming lessons are conducted by professional swimming instructors certified by Singapore Sport Council (SSC) and Singapore Swimming Teachers’ Association (SSTA).
