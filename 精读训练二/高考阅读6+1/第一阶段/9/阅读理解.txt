题目:        Cindi sometimes felt different from her friends. She liked sports, baseball caps, and chewing gum, all things that her friends were certainly not interested in. In early spring, a flyer arrived in the mail. City Co-Ed Soccer Team Tryouts! Saturday only. This was it! A chance to be herself.        Saturday seemed to take forever to arrive. As she parked her bike at the field, her heart sank. How could her luck be so bad? Of the 50 kids there, not one was a girl! “Time for Plan B,” she sighed. She pulled on the sweatpants and tucked (塞进) her hair up into her cap. Her heart raced as she tied her shoes. “Calm down,” she thought. Keeping her head down, she walked over to the field.        The coach’s assistant handed out numbers to wear. “13, just perfect,” Cindi sighed. The first tryout drills divulged Cindi’s many talents. Cindi dribbled (带球) the ball with ease, ran the fastest, and made passes that were always on target. “Nice work, 13,” the assistant said. Cindi was thrilled. For the final tryout, the kids were to kick the ball past the goalkeeper. Each player made several attempts. A few of the boys got the ball past him, but Cindi scored every time.         On the final round of shots, Cindi decided to try a direct kick over his head. Unknown to her, someone had stepped on her shoelace. As she made the final kick, not only did the ball go flying into the net, but it was followed by her shoe! All the kids laughed and pointed. Cindi was frightened! Her tears blurred (使模糊不清) her eyes, and her heart felt like stone. At that time the coach came over. “I’m sorry. I guess I shouldn’t have been there today,” Cindi said. “First of all,” the coach said, “you had every right to be at the tryouts. The team is co-ed, which means it’s open to boys and girls. Unfortunately, we haven’t had any girls show up . . . until now.”        The coach knelt down so that he could see Cindi’s face. “Would you like to play on the team? You have a lot of talent.” Cindi was shocked. This was it! A chance to be herself. “I’d be honored,” she answered with a bow.
