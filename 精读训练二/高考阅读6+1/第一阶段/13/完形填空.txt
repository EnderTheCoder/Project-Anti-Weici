题目:        When I was a small child, during the war, we were very poor and we lived in a faraway village. One day, on the road, I found the ### pieces of a mirror. There was a motorcycle accident.
        I ### to find all the pieces and put them ###, but it was not possible, so I used only the ### piece and I made it round. I could ### with it as a toy and became greatly attracted by the ### that I could reflect light to dark places where the sun would never shine — in ### holes and some other dark places. It became a game for me to ### light into the darkest places I could find.
        I ### the little mirror, and, as I grew up, I would take it out ### I had nothing to do and ### the game.As I became a man, I grew to realize that this was not ### a child’s game but a metaphor (暗喻) for what I might ### my life. I came to ### that I am not the light or the source of light. But light — truth, understanding,knowledge — is there, and it will shine in many dark places ### I reflect it.
        I am just a single piece of a mirror whose ### design and shape I do not know. ###, with what I have I can reflect light into the dark places of this ### — into the black places in the ### of men — and change some things in some people. Perhaps others may see and do the same. This is what I am about. This is the ### of my life.
