题目:        Have you ever seen a windsock blowing in the wind? Well, you can make one of your own! This is a fun project that you can do with things you may have at home. 
You just need to follow a few easy steps.
You will need:
• one piece of heavy colored paper
• five ribbons (丝带)
• strong tape
• a string
• a pencil
What to do:
Step 1: First, decorate the paper. You can draw pictures on it. You can write your name. Do anything that will make it special to you. 
Step 2: Roll the paper into the shape of a tube. Hold one of the shorter edges over the other. Then tape the tube together at each end and in the middle.
Step 3: Use a pencil to poke (戳) a hole into both sides of the tube. The holes should be only on one end of the tube. Pull the string through both holes. Then tie the ends of the string together.
Step 4: Now poke five holes around the top of the other end of the tube. Put a ribbon through each of the holes. Tie a knot (绳结) in the ends. Make sure the knots are bigger than the holes.
        Now your windsock is ready to use, but how does it work? Wind flows through the tube and makes it fly and dance around. Hold the windsock up in the air by its string and run around. It will fly behind you. You can also hang it outside and watch it dance around on its own!
