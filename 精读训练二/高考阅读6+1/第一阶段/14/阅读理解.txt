题目:        People in the Americas have been making popcorn for more than 1,000 years.They didn’t just eat the popcorn. Some people wore it around their necks, too. Even today, people still string popcorn as a decoration during the winter holidays.        Today we cook popcorn in many ways. We can put it in a pot with oil. We can put bags of popcorn in the microwave oven. There are even poppers that blow hot air to cook the corn.        Many years ago, people of the Americas cooked popcorn in different ways, too.They would throw the corn into the fire. When the corn heated, the cooked kernels (粒) would fly out. Sometimes people would just throw kernels into the fire. When the popcorn popped, they would pick up the cooked popcorn from all around the fire. Another way to cook popcorn was to put it in a pot with sand, instead of with the oil we would use today. The popcorn would jump to the top of the sand when it popped.        When settlers came to America, they found a new way to eat popcorn: with milk poured over it, just like you eat cereal (谷类早餐食品). Now we like to eat popcorn with butter and salt.        The Science of Popcorn        No matter how you eat it, popcorn is fun. The real question is: what makes it pop?        When you look at those tiny kernels of popcorn, they look dry. But popcorn kernels are all wet on the inside.Inside each kernel is a tiny drop of water. When the kernel is heated, the water heats up, too. The drop of water heats up and turns to steam. This is when the fun begins. Steam takes up more space than water. As steam fills the inside of the kernel, the corn inside starts to puff up (膨胀). There is no room in the tiny kernel. The inside of the kernel gets bigger and bigger. The hard shell of the kernel pops wide open. The kernel turns inside out, and the popcorn is ready to eat.        This just goes to show that the popcorn can be many things. It is a decoration and a fun food that is fun to eat, and it is a way to learn about science, too.
