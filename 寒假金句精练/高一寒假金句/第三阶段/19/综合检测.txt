题目:Types of Fire Extinguishers
      Fire extinguishers are marked according to the kind of fire on which they should be used. Using the wrong type of extinguisher can be dangerous and make things worse.
      Type A extinguishers are used for fires on paper, cloth, wood, rubber, many
plastics and so on. These types of fires usually leave ashes when they burn, so use Type A extinguishers for fires that leave ashes.
      Type B extinguishers are used for burning liquids, such as oil, gasoline, and paints. These substances often come in barrel-shaped (桶形的) containers, so use Type B extinguishers for such barrels.
      Type C extinguishers are used for electrical fires. Electricity travels in a circuit (电路), so use Type C extinguishers for circuits.
      Remember, A is for Ashes, B is for Barrels, and C is for Circuits. Make sure you have the correct type of fire extinguisher before you try to use it.
Using a Fire Extinguisher
      To help you remember how to use a fire extinguisher, learn PASS. PASS stands for Pull, Aim, Squeeze (挤压), and Sweep.
      Pull the pin at the top of the extinguisher cylinder (圆筒).
      Aim the nozzle (喷嘴) at the base of the fire.
      Squeeze or press the handle.
      Sweep the spray (喷雾) from side-to-side at the fire's base until it goes out.
