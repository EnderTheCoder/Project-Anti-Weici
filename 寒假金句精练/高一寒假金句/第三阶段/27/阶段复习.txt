题目:      How much do consumers care about the carbon footprint of the products they buy? Would they care more if the goods were labeled (贴标签) with emissions (排放物) data? Does it matter at which stage in the lifecycle of a product the carbon is emitted? Research published in the  International Journal of Environmental Policy and Decision Making offers a way to find out.
      Study participants view a carbon footprint label as similar to labels that have appeared on some existing products.The label displays the carbon dioxide emissions related to their production, transportation, usage and disposal (处理), thus showing the buyer the likely effect on climate change of buying a particular product.
      In the first group of studies, the research team proved that carbon emissions and a carbon emissions label would indeed play a role in consumer product decisions, although not as great a role as price. In a second set of studies, the team found that emissions related to usage were most important to consumers followed by the transportation and disposal stages. The carbon footprint of the producing process was considered less important to consumers than the other stages in the product's lifecycle because it is outside the consumer's control. That is, the participants felt they
were less responsible for carbon emitted during producing process. Consumers value recycling a product, but the researchers found that, overall, the consumers would prefer producers to offset (补偿) carbon emissions rather than have to address the problem directly themselves.
      Consumers are increasingly concerned with climate change problems, and already carbon labeling is appearing on some products. “We find that participants not only take the carbon label into account when making product decisions, but they want detailed information on the label,” the researchers explain. They suggest that companies should prepare for how carbon emissions labels might affect future consumer choice.
