题目:      How you move and gesture says as much about you as what comes out of your mouth.
      Jenny Smith, 34, an assistant vice-president at a bank in New York, was interviewing candidates (应考人) for a position which required a person with good communication skills.
      One candidate in particular stood out, but not in a good way. While she could have been very intelligent, her body language sent out very different messages. Her handshake was more of a finger shake, and her eye contact was weak.
      To Jenny, what the candidate said didn't matter because her body language said everything: she wasn't suitable for the position. The candidate may have been quite appropriate (合适的), but she didn't manage to get that across. So our body language may not do us justice. But there are some signals which are very common and are worth a thousand words.
      For example, a handshake can say much more than “hello, nice to meet you”. The most important part of a handshake is palm-to-palm contact. It's even more important than how strong your handshake is. The palm-to-palm contact makes people seem honest: it seems to say “I am sincere (真诚的)”. 
      A weak handshake — when the palms don't touch — makes you seem unfriendly, insincere.But people sometimes use body language to give each other the wrong impression. Somebody who has a firm handshake may be pretending to be sincere, and somebody with a weak handshake may just be a bit shy and nothing more.
      Body language can also be overdone. While eye contact gives an impression of friendliness, too much eye contact or eye contact which is too intense (极为强烈的) can make people feel uncomfortable.
