题目:      A few years ago I decided to grow vegetables in the backyard. I'm an organic (有机的) gardener. I helped run the three-generation-old family vegetable and fruit farm, so I believed I knew much about gardening.
      Believing a small amount of manure (粪肥) would work, I made a few phone calls and the truck was soon on its way. It was a big truck. “Excuse me but there must be a mistake. I only ordered a small amount of it, but …”Obviously, I didn't have a choice as he put it down in my backyard.
      As the manure was being put down I could hardly breathe. When the truck left, I realized that the smell was really terrible and it was drifting (飘散). Soon, for blocks, everyone knew there was a terrible accident somewhere.
      After days of hard work, I had tried everything I could find to get rid of it, but there was still a pile (堆) left. In the middle of the night I woke with a brilliant idea. I would put a sign on the pile and see what would happen.
      I laughed so hard because within hours of putting up the sign, people came from blocks away. They brought baskets, bags, and some really funny containers. I don't know how they heard so fast that I was trying to get rid of the manure. I was so absorbed (全神贯注的) in watching that I forgot to take pictures of them all. The whole pile was gone in less than an hour.
答案:
