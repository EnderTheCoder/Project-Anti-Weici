题目:ALL NEW!
      REPTILE (爬行动物) PETTING ZOO at the Oak Park Nature Center Kids! Are you tired of Mom or Dad dragging you to the same old petting zoos, where (if you're lucky) you might get to touch a little rabbit or goat?
      Mom or Dad! Are you tired of hearing your kids complain about how animals in the same old petting zoos are monotonous?
Consider This:
      The fact is that most mammals are boringly warm, furry, and come in a limited range of dull colours. Reptiles, on the other hand, are cold-blooded and covered with scales (鳞) of attractive colours, from bright green to bright red to dark purple-red. Some, like the chameleon, can even CHANGE colors. Did you ever see a rabbit with scales and a purple tongue almost as long as its body? NO! In our zoo, you can see pet skinks (蜥蜴), snakes, bearded dragons,and other fascinating creatures! Learn what these reptiles eat and how they care for their babies, which ones live in the desert and which live in wetlands, which ones are meat-eaters and which are vegetarians (素食动物), which ones are deadly poisonous and which are not.
So Remember:
      If you're bored with furry animals like rabbits ...
      Then the place for YOU is the Reptile Petting Zoo!
      Bring the WHOLE family — Grandpa, Grandma, Cousin Irene, even baby Joe! There's something for EVERYONE!
