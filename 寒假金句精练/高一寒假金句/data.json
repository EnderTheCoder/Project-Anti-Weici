     A few years ago I decided to grow vegetables in the backyard. I'm an organic (有机的) gardener. I helped run the three-generation-old family vegetable and fruit farm, so I believed I knew much about gardening.\n      Believing a small amount of manure (粪肥) would work, I made a few phone calls and the truck was soon on its way. It was a big truck. “Excuse me but there must be a mistake. I only ordered a small amount of it, but …”Obviously, I didn't have a choice as he put it down in my backyard.\n      As the manure was being put down I could hardly breathe. When the truck left, I realized that the smell was really terrible and it was drifting (飘散). Soon, for blocks, everyone knew there was a terrible accident somewhere.\n      After days of hard work, I had tried everything I could find to get rid of it, but there was still a pile (堆) left. In the middle of the night I woke with a brilliant idea. I would put a sign on the pile and see what would happen.\n      I laughed so hard because within hours of putting up the sign, people came from blocks away. They brought baskets, bags, and some really funny containers. I don't know how they heard so fast that I was trying to get rid of the manure. I was so absorbed (全神贯注的) in watching that I forgot to take pictures of them all. The whole pile was gone in less than an hour.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"高一阅读B版第三周  星期一","sub":"[{\"id\":5334,\"main_id\":10804,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"The author seemed to be very experienced in________.\",\"answer\":\"A. gardening\",\"answer_a\":\"A. gardening\",\"answer_b\":\"B. marketing\",\"answer_c\":\"C. performing\",\"answer_d\":\"D. designing\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p>1.A 事实细节题 根据第一段中的I helped run the three-generation-old family vegetable and fruit farm, so I believed Iknew much about gardening可知答案。</p>\"},{\"id\":5335,\"main_id\":10804,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"In Paragraph 3, the author mainly meant to ________.\",\"answer\":\"C. show how terrible the smell was\",\"answer_a\":\"A. explain why she had so much manure\",\"answer_b\":\"B. explain how to use manure\",\"answer_c\":\"C. show how terrible the smell was\",\"answer_d\":\"D. share her knowledge about manure\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p>2.C 推理判断题 通读第三段可知，作者主要想说明粪肥刺鼻的味道，故C项正确。</p>\"},{\"id\":5336,\"main_id\":10804,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What can we learn about the author?\",\"answer\":\"D.

     It's generally believed that people act the way they do because of their personalities and attitudes. They recycle their garbage because they care about the environment. They pay $5 for a caramel brulée latte (焦糖布丁拿铁咖啡) because they like expensive coffee drinks.\n      ①It's undeniable (毋庸置疑的) that behavior comes from our inner dispositions (性情), but in many particular cases we also draw inferences about who we are, as suggested by the social psychologist Daryl Bem, by observing our own behavior. We can be strangers to ourselves. If we knew our own minds, why would we need to guess what our preferences are from our behavior? If our minds were an open book, we would know exactly how much we care about the environment or like lattes. Actually, we often need to look to our behavior to figure out who we are.\n      Moreover, we don't just use our behavior to learn about our particular types of character — we infer characters that weren't there before. Our behavior is often shaped by little pressures around us, which we fail to recognize. Maybe we recycle because our wives and neighbors would disapprove if we didn't. Maybe we buy lattes in order to impress the people around us. We should not mistakenly believe that we always behave as a result of some inner disposition.\n      Whatever pressures there can be or inferences one can make, people become what they do, though it may not be in compliance (符合) with their true desires.

Are you tired of Mom or Dad dragging you to the same old petting zoos, where (if you're lucky) you might get to touch a little rabbit or goat?\n      Mom or Dad! Are you tired of hearing your kids complain about how animals in the same old petting zoos are monotonous?\nConsider This:\n      The fact is that most mammals are boringly warm, furry, and come in a limited range of dull colours. Reptiles, on the other hand, are cold-blooded and covered with scales (鳞) of attractive colours, from bright green to bright red to dark purple-red. Some, like the chameleon, can even CHANGE colors. Did you ever see a rabbit with scales and a purple tongue almost as long as its body? NO! In our zoo, you can see pet skinks (蜥蜴), snakes, bearded dragons,and other fascinating creatures! Learn what these reptiles eat and how they care for their babies, which ones live in the desert and which live in wetlands, which ones are meat-eaters and which are vegetarians (素食动物), which ones are deadly poisonous and which are not.\nSo Remember:\n      If you're bored with furry animals like rabbits ...\n      Then the place for YOU is the Reptile Petting Zoo!\n      Bring the WHOLE family — Grandpa, Grandma, Cousin Irene, even baby Joe!

While she could have been very intelligent, her body language sent out very different messages. Her handshake was more of a finger shake, and her eye contact was weak.\n      To Jenny, what the candidate said didn't matter because her body language said everything: she wasn't suitable for the position. The candidate may have been quite appropriate (合适的), but she didn't manage to get that across. So our body language may not do us justice. But there are some signals which are very common and are worth a thousand words.\n      For example, a handshake can say much more than “hello, nice to meet you”. The most important part of a handshake is palm-to-palm contact. It's even more important than how strong your handshake is. The palm-to-palm contact makes people seem honest: it seems to say “I am sincere (真诚的)”. \n      A weak handshake — when the palms don't touch — makes you seem unfriendly, insincere.But people sometimes use body language to give each other the wrong impression.

     Getting less sleep has become a bad habit for most American kids. According to a new survey (调查) by the National Sleep Foundation, 51% of kids aged 10 to 18 go to bed at 10 pm or later on school nights, even though they have to get up early. Last year the Foundation reported that nearly 60% of 7- to 12-year-olds said they felt tired during the day, and 15% said they had fallen asleep at school.\n      How much sleep you need depends a lot on your age. Babies need a lot of rest: most of them sleep about 18 hours a day! Adults need about eight hours. For most school-age children, ten hours is ideal (理想的). But the new National Sleep Foundation survey found that 35% of 10- to 12-year-olds get only seven or eight hours. And guess what almost half of the surveyed kids said they do before bedtime? Watch TV.\n    “More children are going to bed with TVs on, and there are more opportunities (机会) to stay awake, with more homework, the Internet and the phone,” says Dr. Mary Carskadon, a sleep researcher at Brown University Medical School. She says these activities at bedtime can get kids all excited and make it hard for them to calm down and sleep. Other experts say part of the problem is chemical. Changing levels of body chemicals called hormones not only make teenagers' bodies develop adult characteristics, but also make it hard for teenagers to fall asleep before 11 pm.\n      Because sleepiness is such a problem for teenagers, some school districts have decided to start high school classes later than they used to. Three years ago, schools in Edina, Minnesota, changed the start time from 7:25 am to 8:30 am. Students, parents and teachers are pleased with the results.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"17年浙江高考真题","sub":"[{\"id\":2813,\"main_id\":11278,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What is the new National Sleep Foundation survey on?\",\"answer\":\"A.

Using the wrong type of extinguisher can be dangerous and make things worse.\n      Type A extinguishers are used for fires on paper, cloth, wood, rubber, many\nplastics and so on. These types of fires usually leave ashes when they burn, so use Type A extinguishers for fires that leave ashes.\n      Type B extinguishers are used for burning liquids, such as oil, gasoline, and paints. These substances often come in barrel-shaped (桶形的) containers, so use Type B extinguishers for such barrels.\n      Type C extinguishers are used for electrical fires. Electricity travels in a circuit (电路), so use Type C extinguishers for circuits.\n      Remember, A is for Ashes, B is for Barrels, and C is for Circuits. Make sure you have the correct type of fire extinguisher before you try to use it.\nUsing a Fire Extinguisher\n      To help you remember how to use a fire extinguisher, learn PASS. PASS stands for Pull, Aim, Squeeze (挤压), and Sweep.\n      Pull the pin at the top of the extinguisher cylinder (圆筒).\n      Aim the nozzle (喷嘴) at the base of the fire.\n      Squeeze or press the handle.\n      Sweep the spray (喷雾) from side-to-side at the fire's base until it goes out.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"goes out","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"高一阅读B版第九周 星期二","sub":"[{\"id\":3127,\"main_id\":11344,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"The purpose of the text is to ________.\",\"answer\":\"A. inform\",\"answer_a\":\"A. inform\",\"answer_b\":\"B. persuade\",\"answer_c\":\"C. entertain\",\"answer_d\":\"D. comment\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"1.

One day, this approach threw me into embarrassment.\n      In Mrs. Totten's eighth-grade math class at Central Avenue School in Anderson, Indiana, we were learning to add and subtract decimals (小数).\n      Our teacher typically assigned daily homework, which would be recited in class the following day. On most days, our grades were based on our oral answers to homework questions.\n      Mrs. Totten usually walked up and down the rows of desks requesting answers from student after student in the order the questions had appeared on our homework sheets. She would start either at the front or the back of the classroom and work toward the other end.\n      Since I was seated near the middle of about 35 students, it was easy to figure out which questions I might have to answer. This particular time, I had completed my usual two or three problems according to my calculations.\n      What I failed to expect was that several students were absent, which threw off my estimate. As Mrs. Totten made her way from the beginning of the class，I desperately tried to determine which math problem I would get. I tried to work it out before she got to me, but I had brain freeze and couldn't function.\n      When Mrs. Totten reached my desk, she asked what answer I'd got for problem No. 14. “I…I didn't get anything,” I answered, and my face felt warm. \n    “Correct,” she said.\n      It turned out that the correct answer was zero.\nWhat did I learn that day? First, always do all your homework. Second, in real life it isn't always what you say but how you say it that matters. Third, I would never make it as a mathematician.\nIf I could choose one school day that taught me the most, it would be that one.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"doing any more than necessary was wasted effort","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"2014湖南高考真题  B篇","sub":"[{\"id\":3133,\"main_id\":11411,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What does the underlined part in Paragraph 1 indicate?\",\"answer\":\"D.

It is a marsupial (有袋目哺乳动物), and like kangaroos, a female koala carries her baby in her pouch (育儿袋) for about six months.\n      Koalas live in four states only in eastern Australia, where the eucalyptus (桉树) trees they love are most plentiful.\n      In fact, they rarely leave these trees, their sharp claws easily keeping them high up in the air.\n      During the day they sleep for up to 18 hours. When not asleep, they feed on eucalyptus leaves, especially at night.\n      Koalas do not drink much water as they get most of their amount for its size — about two and a half pounds of leaves a day, even storing snacks of leaves in pouches in their cheeks.\n      The koala bears were widely hunted during the 1920s and 1930s and their populations decreased suddenly. Helped by reintroduction, they have reappeared over much of their former range, but their populations are smaller. Koalas need a lot of space — about a hundred trees per animal — which is a pressing problem, as Australia's woodlands continue to get smaller because the trees they live on are being cut down to make farms. Also, forest fires, caused by heat waves, are destroying the forests the koalas live in.\n      It has been estimated (估算) that there are only 100,000 koalas left in the wild, with the lowest estimates being no more than 43,000. The Koala can only eat eucalyptus leaves and lives nowhere else except Australia, so in order to survive, human effect on its limited environment must be controlled, or this attractive creature faces certain extinction.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"高一阅读B版第六周星期一","sub":"[{\"id\":2825,\"main_id\":11483,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What can be learned about Koalas?\",\"answer\":\"B.

Think of the people who belong to book groups. They choose books to read and then meet to discuss them. Now, the website BookCrossing.com turns the page on the traditional idea of a book group. \n      Members go on the site and register the books they own and would like to share. BookCrossing provides an identification number to stick inside the book. Then the person leaves it in a public place, hoping that the book will have an adventure, traveling far and wide with each new reader who finds it. \n      Bruce Pederson, the managing director of BookCrossing, says, “The two things that change your life are the people you meet and books you read. BookCrossing combines both.” \n      Members leave books on park benches and buses, in train stations and coffee shops. Whoever finds their book will go to the site and record where they found it. \nPeople who find a book can also leave a journal entry describing what they thought of it. E-mails are then sent to the BookCrossers to keep them updated about where their books have been found. Bruce Pederson says the idea is for people not to be selfish by keeping a book to gather dust on a shelf at home. \n      BookCrossing is part of a trend among people who want to get back to the “real” and not the virtual (虚拟).

When she was just 13 years old, she and her friend were surfing in the ocean.\n      While they were surfing, a shark attacked Hamilton. In the attack, Hamilton lost her left arm.\nHamilton was rushed to the hospital. When she got to the hospital, she had already lost more than half of her blood. She almost died, but doctors saved her life.\n      Hamilton loved surfing, and she didn't want to stop. Of course, now it was much harder for her, because she only had one arm. First, she got a special surfboard. This board was thicker, and it was easier to control. Then, she started to exercise her legs. She needed stronger legs because she had to kick more to push the board through the water. Finally, she learned how to surf with only one arm. Less than one month after Hamilton lost her arm, she was surfing again.\n      Today, Hamilton is a professional surfer. She surfs in competitions around the world. She has been in competitions in the USA, Brazil, and Australia. In total, she has won four major competitions. She no longer needs a special surfboard. She uses the same kind of surfboard that everyone else uses.\n      Hamilton uses her experience to teach people to never give up. She wrote a book about the shark attack and her difficulties. She also goes on television shows and talks about her experiences. In 2011, there was even a movie about her life. She has also won several awards for her courage.\n      Hamilton says that helping people has been a wonderful experience for her. She says that she has learned a lotabout life, love, and being strong. However, although so many things have happened to her, she says she is still just a surfer.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"高一阅读B版第五周 星期一","sub":"[{\"id\":2867,\"main_id\":11773,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"How different was Hamilton's new surfboard?\",\"answer\":\"B.

When they do break down, they polluted the soil and water with chemicals.\n      Professor Pol, a chemical engineer, asked his team to help find a better way to deal with old packing peanuts. The scientists discovered that when they heated the peanuts — between 500 and 900 degrees Celsius — they turned into a carbon-based material that could be flattened into very thin sheets.\n      These microsheets can be used to make anodes (正极), a key part of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (锂电池).(The anode is where electrically charged molecules (分子) called lithium ions are stored when a battery is recharged.)\n      Anodes are usually made from a kind of carbon. However, anodes made from recycled packing peanuts are cheaper to make, less harmful to the environment, and work better than traditional carbon anodes.\n      Lithium-ion batteries are used in many electronic devices, including smartphones, laptops, cameras and even electric cars. Anodes made from packing peanuts could be ready for commercial use within two years.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"高一阅读B版第7周星期四","sub":"[{\"id\":2871,\"main_id\":11838,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What is the biggest disadvantage of used packing peanuts?\",\"answer\":\"D.

Would they care more if the goods were labeled (贴标签) with emissions (排放物) data? Does it matter at which stage in the lifecycle of a product the carbon is emitted? Research published in the  International Journal of Environmental Policy and Decision Making offers a way to find out.\n      Study participants view a carbon footprint label as similar to labels that have appeared on some existing products.The label displays the carbon dioxide emissions related to their production, transportation, usage and disposal (处理), thus showing the buyer the likely effect on climate change of buying a particular product.\n      In the first group of studies, the research team proved that carbon emissions and a carbon emissions label would indeed play a role in consumer product decisions, although not as great a role as price. In a second set of studies, the team found that emissions related to usage were most important to consumers followed by the transportation and disposal stages. The carbon footprint of the producing process was considered less important to consumers than the other stages in the product's lifecycle because it is outside the consumer's control. That is, the participants felt they\nwere less responsible for carbon emitted during producing process. Consumers value recycling a product, but the researchers found that, overall, the consumers would prefer producers to offset (补偿) carbon emissions rather than have to address the problem directly themselves.\n      Consumers are increasingly concerned with climate change problems, and already carbon labeling is appearing on some products. “We find that participants not only take the carbon label into account when making product decisions, but they want detailed information on the label,” the researchers explain. They suggest that companies should prepare for how carbon emissions labels might affect future consumer choice.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"address","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"高一阅读B版第17周  星期二","sub":"[{\"id\":3799,\"main_id\":11880,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Which of the following most affects consumer choice according to the first study?\",\"answer\":\"B.
