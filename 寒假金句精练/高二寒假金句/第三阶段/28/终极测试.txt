题目:    Why Do We Call Them Special Senses?
    While learning the science lessons, I used to get a doubt — why ear, nose, tongue and eyes should be called as special senses? The basic reason is that these are the channels through which we keep contact with the surroundings. Though apparently it may feel like these are individual sensory organs, they do show some connectivity. Interestingly, our hearing is less sharp after we eat a heavy food. Isn't it good for a sound nap after a stomach-full meal? That does not mean we go deaf after a meal, but the hearing pitch (强度) does change after a heavy meal.
    We usually give credit of the taste to our tongue, but do you know that unless saliva (唾液) dissolves something, our tongue cannot recognize the taste of the food eaten. Taste is nothing but the food chemicals dissolved in the saliva being sensed by the taste buds present on the tongue. Try to dry off your tongue and mouth with a tissue paper and then taste something.
    Women are much better smellers than men. They are born with this characteristic ability and can correctly tell the exact fragrance of the sample. We all can store almost 50,000 different scents (气味), which are strongly tied to the memories.
    Pupils (瞳孔) do not respond to light alone, but to the slightest bit of noise around too. Thus surgeons, watchmakers and those professionals who have to perform a much delicate job do prefer to have a sound-free environment. Even a small noise can dilate (扩大) their pupils, change the focus and blur (使模糊) their vision. If you do not wear glasses or contact lens due to having a 6/6 vision, you are just among the one third of the human population. It is now statistically proved that only one third of the population has perfect vision, and the rest are either wearing glasses or are trying to read with a compromised vision.
    Each and every one of us has a particular or individualistic or characteristic smell, which is unique to us, except for twins. This smell is very subtle (微妙的) yet can be sensed even by a newborn. It may be due to this scent that the newborn recognizes the presence of his parents around. Many of us can tell the smell of our significant friends and colleagues. A significant part of this phenomenon is guided by genetics but it is also modified by the environment, diet and personal hygiene. This all together creates the unique chemistry that is individualistic for each person.
