   The English language is changing, and you are responsible! Whether we consider changes in grammar, spelling, pronunciation, or the very vocabulary of the language, you have played your part and continue to do so.\n    When we first learned basic grammar and spelling, perhaps in elementary school, we might have gotten the impression that these things were sacred. The rules that apply to such things might have been presented as unchanging and unchangeable. While this approach might be beneficial for teaching children, it is far from accurate.\n    The English language, like many others, is a living and growing thing. Like it or not, you are involved in this change. These changes take many forms. Grammar and spelling have changed radically (根本地) over the years and centuries, with the spelling differences in different countries today a reflection of this. While the language of a thousand years ago might be called English, most of us would hardly recognize it today as the same language.\n    The first involves changes in the pronunciation of words. Many are familiar with the differences between the British and American ways of pronouncing certain words. In addition to these differences, the pronunciation of many words has changed over the years because of how you have decided to pronounce them. For example, consider the word “err”. The traditional pronunciation of this word rhymes with the word “her”. Older dictionaries show this to be the primary or only pronunciation. However in recent years, more and more people have been pronouncing it so that it sounds like “air”. Another change in the language involves the addition and removal of words. The makers of dictionaries decide which words deserve to be officially adopted as part of the English language. Through the centuries, many words have come from other languages. In fact, English has probably done this more than any other language in the world, which is why spelling and pronunciation rules for English have so many exceptions. \n    Of course many slang (俚语) words have been just short-lived craze (风行一时的东西) that have died out quickly. Others, though, have been adopted by mainstream society and become respectable, as have many technical terms. So then remember, the next time you repeat the newest expression to hit the streets, or make up your own words, you may be contributing to the future of the English language.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"拓展阅读 Unit10  C篇","sub":"[{\"id\":4720,\"main_id\":14625,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"When we begin to learn English, we think __________.\",\"answer\":\"C. grammar and spelling rules are unchangeable\",\"answer_a\":\"A. it is interesting to pick up a new language\",\"answer_b\":\"B.

   Jimmy is an automotive mechanic, but he lost his job a few months ago. He has a good heart, but always feared applying for a new job. \n    One day, he gathered up all his strength and decided to attend a job interview. His appointment was at 10 am and it was already 8:30. While waiting for a bus to the office where he was supposed to be interviewed, he saw an elderly man wildly kicking the tire of his car. Obviously there was something wrong with the car. Jimmy immediately went up to lend him a hand. When Jimmy finished working on the car, the old man asked him how much he should pay for the service. Jimmy said there was no need to pay him; he just helped someone in need, and he had to rush for an interview. Then the old man said, “Well, I could take you to the office for your interview. It's the least I could do. Please. I insist.” Jimmy agreed. \n    Upon arrival, Jimmy found a long line of applicants waiting to be interviewed. Jimmy still had some grease (油垢) on him after the car repair, but he did not have much time to wash it off or have a change of shirt. One by one, the applicants left the interviewer's office with disappointed looks on their faces. Finally his name was called. The interviewer was sitting on a large chair facing the office window. Rocking the chair back and forth, he asked, “Do you really need to be interviewed?” Jimmy's heart sank. “With the way I look now, how could I possibly pass this interview?” he thought to himself. \n    Then the interviewer turned the chair and to Jimmy's surprise, it was the old man he helped earlier in the morning. It turned out he was the General Manager of the company. \n  “Sorry I had to keep you waiting, but I was pretty sure I made the right decision to have you as part of our workforce before you even stepped into the office. I just know you'd be a trustworthy worker. Congratulations!” Jimmy sat down and they shared a cup of well-deserved coffee as he landed himself a new job.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"拓展阅读 Unit 12 D篇","sub":"[{\"id\":4728,\"main_id\":14659,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Why did Jimmy apply for a new job?\",\"answer\":\"A.

   For many parents, raising a teenager is like fighting a long war, but years go by without any clear winner. Like a border conflict between neighboring countries, the parent-teen war is about boundaries: Where is the line between what I control and what you do?\n    Both sides want peace, but neither feels it has any power to stop the conflict. In part, this is because neither is willing to admit any responsibility for starting it. From the parents' point of view, the only cause of their fight is their adolescents' complete unreasonableness. And of course, the teens see it in exactly the same way, except oppositely. Both feel trapped.\n    In this article, I'll describe three no-win situations that commonly arise between teens and parents and then suggest some ways out of the trap. The first no-win situation is quarrels over unimportant things. Examples include the color of the teen's hair, the cleanliness of the bedroom, the preferred style of clothing, the child's failure to eat a good breakfast before school, or his tendency o sleep until noon on the weekends. Second, blaming. The goal of a blaming battle is to make the other admit that his bad attitude is the reason why everything goes wrong. Third, needing to be right. It doesn't matter what the topic is — politics, the laws of physics, or the proper way to break an egg — the point of these arguments is to prove that you are right and the other person is wrong, for both wish to be considered an authority — someone who actually knows something — and therefore to command respect. Unfortunately, as long as parents and teens continue to assume that they know more than the other, they'll continue to fight these battles forever and never make any real progress.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"the teens see it in exactly the same way, except oppositely.","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"10 湖北阅读B篇","sub":"[{\"id\":4801,\"main_id\":14693,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Why does the author compare the parent-teen war to a border conflict?\",\"answer\":\"B.

   Life can be so wonderful, full of adventure and joy. It can also be full of challenges, setbacks (挫折) and heartbreaks. Whatever our circumstances, we generally still have dreams, hopes and desires — that little something more we want for ourselves and our loved ones. ①Yet knowing we can have more can also create a problem, because when we go to change the way we do things, up come the old patterns and pitfalls (陷阱) that stopped us from seeking what we wanted in the first place.\n    This tension between what we feel we can have and what we're seemingly able to have is the niggling (烦人的) suffering, the anxiety we feel. This is where we usually think it's easier to just give up. But we're never meant to let go of the part of us that knows we can have more. The intelligence behind that knowing is us — the real us. It's the part that believes in life and its possibilities. If you drop that, you begin to feel a little “dead” inside because you're dropping “you”.\n    So, if we have this capability (能力) but somehow life seems to keep us stuck, how do we break these patterns?\n    Decide on a new course and make one decision at a time. This is good advice for a new adventure or just getting through today's challenges.\n    ②While, deep down, we know we can do it, our mind — or the minds of those close to us — usually says we can't. That isn't a reason to stop, it's just the mind, that little man or woman on your shoulder, trying to talk you out of something again. It has done it many times before. It's all about starting simple and doing it now.\n    Decide and act before overthinking.

   A world-famous Canadian author, Margaret Atwood, has created the world's first long-distance signing device (装置), the LongPen.\n    After many tiring book-signing tours from city to city, Atwood thought there must be a better way to do them. She hired some technical experts and started her own company in 2004. Together they designed the LongPen. Here's how it works: The author writes a personal message and signature on a computer tablet (手写板) using a special pen. On the receiving end, in another city, a robotic arm fitted with a regular pen signs the book. The author and fan can talk with each other via webcams (网络摄像机) and computer screens.\n    Work on the LongPen began in Atwood's basement (地下室). At first, they had no idea it would be as hard as it turned out to be. The device went through several versions, including one that actually had smoke coming out of it. The inventing finally completed, test runs were made in Ottawa, and the LongPen was officially launched at the 2006 London Book Fair. From here, Atwood conducted two transatlantic (横越大西洋) book signings of her latest book for fans in Toronto and New York City.\nThe LongPen produces a unique signature each time because it copies the movement of the author in real time. It has several other potential applications. It could increase credit card security and allow people to sign contracts from another province. The video exchange between signer and receiver can be recorded on DVD for proof when legal documents are used.\n    \"It's really fun”, said the owner of a bookstore, who was present for one of the test runs. “Obviously you can't shake hands with the author, but there are chances for a connection that you don't get from a regular book signing.”\n    The response to the invention hasn't been all favorable. Atwood has received criticism from authors who think she's trying to end book tours. But she said, “①It will be possible to go to places that you never got sent to before because the publishers couldn't afford it.”","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"14 天津阅读B篇","sub":"[{\"id\":4821,\"main_id\":14741,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Why did Atwood decide to invent the LongPen?\",\"answer\":\"D.

In fact, he's one of your best reporters. He wants to leave.\n    Your reporter gave me a copy of his resume (简历) and photocopies of six stories that he wrote for you. The headlines showed you played them proudly. With great enthusiasm, he talked about how he finds issues (问题), approaches them, and writes about them, which tells me he is one of your best. I'm sure you would hate to lose him. \n    Surprisingly, your reporter is not unhappy. In fact, he told me he really likes his job. He has a great assignment (分工), and said you run a great paper. It would be easy for you to keep him, he said. He knows that the paper values him. He appreciates the responsibility you've given him, takes ownership of his profession, and enjoys his freedom.\n    So why is he looking for a way out?\n    He talked to me because he wants his editors to demand so much more of him. He wants to be pushed, challenged, coached to new heights.\n    The reporter believes that good stories spring from good questions, but his editors usually ask how long the story will be, when it will be in, where it can play, and what the budget is.\nHe longs for conversations with an editor who will help him turn his good ideas into great ones. He wants someone to get excited about what he's doing and to help him turn his story idea upside down and inside out, exploring the best ways to report it. He wants to be more valuable for your paper. That's what you want for him, too, isn't it?\n    So your reporter has set me thinking.\n    Our best hope in keeping our best reporters, copy editors, photographers, artists — everyone — is to work harder to make sure they get the help they are demanding to reach their potential. If we can't do it, they'll find someone who can.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"10 北京阅读B篇","sub":"[{\"id\":4848,\"main_id\":14765,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What does the writer think of the reporter?\",\"answer\":\"C.

And they created a new style for Architecture and Interior Design, named after the famous French Art Institute: Beaux-Arts.\nSieMatic BeauxArts Breaks and Creates\n  In fact it was not a new style at all, but a composition of styles from different periods and cultures. Many world-famous structures (建筑物) such as the Chicago Art Institute and the Statue of Liberty account for it. But what does that have to do with your kitchen? Just as much as you want it to. Because in the same way that the anti-conventional architects back then took the freedom to combine elements from different historical eras, today, you too can break the conventional rules of style and create something new: your own personal composition of your kitchen. For that, SieMatic BeauxArts offers unique opportunities: A broad range of seemingly conflicting features (特征) that you combine to a harmonious design of your own. You can choose from menu of various forms, appealing colors, and precious materials, to create an environment that is much more than just a kitchen: a reflection of your personality.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"Welcome to a new Era of Kitchen Interior (室内的) Design,SieMatic BeauxArts Breaks and Creates,it_10","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"14 江苏阅读A 改","sub":"[{\"id\":4901,\"main_id\":14774,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Why did the BeauxArts style attract American entrepreneurs?\",\"answer\":\"A.

Group exercise is challenging, yet fun and empowering! Of course everyone knows that exercise is good for the body. However, studies have shown that when exercise is performed in groups, it's not only great for improving physical health but for psychological health. It's an opportunity to be social, release endorphins (内啡肽), and improve your strength. Additionally, group exercise creates a community feel and the shared common goal motivates participants to work hard. The instrumental support of taking on a fitness journey with others proves more effective than going to the gym alone.\n    Another beneficial aspect of group exercise is the informational support participants receive from the instructor. Many people fear the gym because they feel lost and don't want to embarrass themselves. If you feel you can relate, then group training is an even better choice for you. It's a great opportunity to learn more about fitness through the clear instruction and supervision (监管) of a fitness instructor. If you're tired of wandering around the gym wasting time and becoming bored, you can attend an upbeat group fitness class that'll keep your workout on track. Don't let fitness frighten you!\n    If you're serious about wanting to live a healthy lifestyle, it's extremely important to surround yourself with people who'll provide you with the proper emotional support. I wouldn't scold anyone for deciding to party on weekends and in turn I wouldn't expect anyone to give offence to me for focusing on my health. Surround yourself with people who uplift, encourage and understand you! Make fitness even more fun by trying something new or any group fitness class, with a friend. Plan to go for a jog together. Then try a fun healthy restaurant or fresh juice bar! Fitness can be both fun and social!\n    Surrounding yourself with people who'll provide you with respect support can be very beneficial while working towards reaching health and fitness goals. First, decide to do it for yourself and work towards staying positive. Then make sure the people you surround yourself with are supportive.

He said he had just been “in the right place at the right time” and did not want his photo taken. \n    In 1991, he came up with a system to organize, link and browse (浏览) Net pages which revolutionized the Internet. The British scientist was knighted (封爵士) for his pioneering work in 2003. \n    Sir Tim created his program while he was at the particle physics institute (粒子物理研究院), Cern, in Geneva. The computer code he came up with let scientists easily share research findings across a computer network. In the early 1990s, it was called the “world wide web”, and is still the basis of the web as we know it. \n    The famous man never went on to commercialize his work. Instead he worked on expanding the use of the Net as a channel for free expression and cooperation. \n    \"The web is encouraging new types of social networks and opening up new ways for information management and business development. The web has obviously improved many people's ability to obtain information central to their lives,” said Pekka Tarjanne, chairman of the Millennium Technology Prize award committee. \n    Just under 80 people from 22 countries were nominated (提名) for the prize for their work in the areas of health, communication, new materials and the environment. \n    The Millennium Technology Prize was set up by the Finnish Technology Award Foundation, an independent body backed by the public and private money which aims to recognize outstanding creations. \n    Sir Tim currently heads up the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, where he is now based as an academic.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"heads up","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"阅读6+1 高考A版 第6周 Tuesday","sub":"[{\"id\":5346,\"main_id\":14838,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"It can be learned from the first two paragraphs that __________.\",\"answer\":\"C. the Internet could not be used so widely without Tim Berners-Lee's invention\",\"answer_a\":\"A. it was Tim Berners-Lee who invented the Internet\",\"answer_b\":\"B. no one was able to surf the Net before the world wide web was invented\",\"answer_c\":\"C. the Internet could not be used so widely without Tim Berners-Lee's invention\",\"answer_d\":\"D. the Millennium Technology Prize was set up for Tim Berners-Lee\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p>1.

These are the Paralympics, the games for athletes with a disability. But in Beijing in 2008, for the first time, one of the greatest Paralympians will not be taking part.\n    She is a British athlete by the name of Tanni Grey-Thompson. Born with spine bifida (脊椎裂) which left her paralysed from the waist down, Tanni used a wheelchair from the age of 7. At first, she was not keen on sport, apart from horse-riding, which gave her a sense of freedom. But in her teens, she started taking sports more seriously. She tried swimming, basketball and tennis. Eventually she found athletics, and never looked back.\n   Indeed, Tanni's athletic career took off. In 1984, when she was 15, she pulled off a surprise victory in the 100 metres at the Junior National Wheelchair Games.\n    In 1988, Tanni went to her first Paralympic Games in Seoul. She won bronze in the 400 metres. Even greater success followed at the 1992 Barcelona Paralympics. Tanni won gold in the 100, 200, 400 and 800 metres relay, setting two world records in the process. In the same year she achieved the first of her six London Wheelchair Marathon victories.\n    Tanni's enduring (持续的) success has been part motivation, part preparation. “The training I do that enables me to be a good sprinter (短跑运动员) enables me to be good at a marathon too. I train 50 weeks of the year and that keeps me prepared for whatever distance I want to race … I am still competing at a very high level, but as I get older things get harder and I want to retire before I fall apart.”\n    Indeed Tanni retired finally after the Visa Paralympic World Cup in 2007. Her wish is to coach young athletes for Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.\n    In spite of ups and downs, she never takes her fate lying down. In her splendid life, she has won an amazing eleven gold medals, four silvers and one bronze in a series (系列) of Paralympics — a top level athletic career covering two decades. She has won the London Wheelchair Marathon six times, more than any other competitor, and she has set over thirty world records.\n    What advice does she have for young athletes? “Work hard at your studies, and then train, train and train again.”","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"that_2","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"08 福建阅读A篇","sub":"[{\"id\":5382,\"main_id\":14865,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Which of the following sports did Tanni like before thirteen?\",\"answer\":\"D.

Teams of four, dressed in a variety of strange and funny clothes, roll a complete cheese along a 50-metre course. On the way, they must not kick or throw their cheese, or go into their competitors' lane (赛道). Competition is fierce and the chief prize is a complete Stilton cheese weighing about four kilos (disappointingly, but understandably the cheeses used in the race are wooden ones). All the competitors are served with beer or port wine, the traditional accompaniment for Stilton cheese.\nFiery Foods Festival — The Hottest Festival on Earth\n    Every year more than 10,000 people head for the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico. They come from as far away as Australia, the Caribbean and China, but they all share a common addiction — food that is not just spicy (辛辣的), but hot enough to make your mouth burn, your head spin and your eyes water. Their destination is the Fiery Food and BBQ Festival which is held over a period of three days every March. You might like to try a chocolate-covered habanero pepper — officially the hottest pepper in the world — or any one of the thousands of products that are on show. But one thing's for sure — If you don't like the feeling of a burning tongue, this festival isn't for you!\nLa Tomatina — The World's Biggest Food Fight\n    On the last Wednesday of every August, the Spanish town of Bunol hosts La Tomatina — the world's largest food fight. A week-long celebration leads up to an exciting tomato battle as the highlight of the week's events. The early morning sees the arrival of large trucks with tomatoes — official fight-starters get things going by casting tomatoes at the crowd.\n    The battle lasts little more than half an hour, in which time around 50,000 kilograms of tomatoes have been thrown at anyone or anything that moves, runs, or fights back. Then everyone heads down to the river to make friends again — and for a much-needed wash!","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"Stilton Cheese Rolling,Fiery Foods Festival — The Hottest Festival on Earth,La Tomatina — The World’s Biggest Food Fight","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"15 福建阅读A篇","sub":"[{\"id\":5390,\"main_id\":14891,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"In the Stilton cheese rolling competition, competitors on each team must __________.\",\"answer\":\"B. roll a wooden cheese in their own lane\",\"answer_a\":\"A. wear various formal clothes\",\"answer_b\":\"B. roll a wooden cheese in their own lane\",\"answer_c\":\"C. kick or throw their cheese\",\"answer_d\":\"D. use a real cheese weighing about four kilos\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p>1.

And I am one of them. Take my family's last vacation. It was my six-year-old son's winter break from school, and we were heading home from Fort Lauderdale after a weeklong trip. The flight was overbooked, and Delta, the airline, offered us $400 per person in credits to give up our seats and leave the next day. I had meetings in New York, so I had to get back. But that didn't mean my husband and my son couldn't stay. I took my nine-month-old and took off for home. \n    The next day, my husband and son were offered more credits to take an even later flight. Yes, I encouraged — okay, ordered — them to wait it out at the airport, to “earn” more Delta Dollars. Our total take: $1,600. Not bad, huh? \n    Now some people may think I'm a bad mother and not such a great wife either. But as a big-time bargain hunter, I know the value of a dollar. And these days, a good deal is something few of us can afford to pass up. \n    I've made a living looking for the best deals and exposing the worst tricks. I have been the consumer reporter of NBC's Today show for over a decade. ①I have written a couple of books including one titled Tricks of the Trade: A Consumer Survival Guide. And I really do what I believe in. \n    I tell you this because there is no shame in getting your money's worth. I'm also tightfisted when it comes to shoes, clothes for my children, and expensive restaurants. But I wouldn't hesitate to spend on a good haircut. It keeps its shape longer, and it's the first thing people notice. And I will also spend on a classic piece of furniture.

It requires you to predict what other road users will do and get ready to react to something unexpected. When alcohol is consumed, it enters your bloodstream and acts as a depressant (抑制药), damaging eyesight, judgement and co-ordination (协调), slowing down reaction time and greatly increasing the risk of accidents. Even below the drink driving limit, driving will be affected.\n    Alcohol may take a few minutes to be absorbed into the bloodstream and start action on the brain. Absorption rate is increased when drinking on an empty stomach or when consuming drinks mixed with fruit juice. To get rid of alcohol from the body is a very slow process and it is not possible to speed it up with any measures like taking a shower or having a cup of tea or coffee.\nThe present Road Traffic Ordinance states clearly that the limit of alcohol concentration is:\n● 50 milligrams of alcohol per 100ml of blood; or\n● 22 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath; or\n● 67 milligrams of alcohol per 100ml of urine (尿液)\nDrivers who cause traffic accidents, or who commit a moving traffic offence or are being suspected of drink driving will be tested.\nAny driver found drinking beyond the limit will be charged. The driver declared guilty may be fined a maximum of HK $25,000 and be sentenced to up to 3 years in prison and punished for 10 driving-offence points; or temporarily banned from driving.\nThe same punishment applies to failing to provide specimens (样本) for breath, blood or urine tests without good excuse.\nDrink driving is a criminal offence. Be a responsible driver, think before you drink. For the safety of yourself and other road users, never drive after consuming alcohol.

Actually, the past decades has seen more and more forests disappearing and the globe becoming increasingly warm. People now realize that this unhealthy situation must be changed, and that we must be able to develop in sustainable (可持续的) ways. That means growth with low carbon or development of sustainable products. In other words, we should keep the earth healthy while using its supply of natural resources. \n    Today, sustainable development is a popular trend in many countries. According to a recent study, the global market for low-carbon energy will become three times bigger over the next decade. China, for example, has set its mind on leading that market, hoping to seize chances in the new round of the global energy revolution. It is now trying hard to make full use of wind and solar energy, and is spending a huge amount of money making electric cars and high-speed trains. In addition, we are also seeing great growth in the global markets for sustainable products such as palm oil (棕榈油), which is produced without cutting down valuable rainforest. In recent years the markets for sustainable products have grown by more than 50%. \n    Governments can fully develop the potential of these new markets. First, they can set high targets for reducing carbon emissions (排放) and targets for saving and reusing energy. Besides, stronger arrangement of public resources like forests can also help to speed up the development. Finally, governments can avoid the huge public expenses that are taking us in the wrong direction, and redirecting some of those expenses can accelerate the change from the traditional model to a sustainable one. \n    The major challenge of this century is to find ways to meet the needs of a growing population within the limits of this single planet.

On that particular day, a south wind had been gusting (劲吹) on and off all morning. It was not strong enough to cause us any concern, so we carried on with our daily work, not suspecting what was about to happen.\n    The storm gave us very little warning. Black clouds loomed (逼近) over the distant horizon (地平线) so suddenly that we were taken by surprise. Even then, we were not really worried, as the clouds seemed to be moving over our house and towards the distant mountains. Then, just as the clouds had moved inland, the wind suddenly swung around in a full circle and we were facing a major storm.\n    Instantly, we were busily preparing for the worst. The whole family had experienced such a storm before and everyone remembered the damage it had caused to stock and crops. There was very little we could do about the crops. But we needed to protect the animals in case the river flooded again. My older brother called his sheep-dog and began driving our small flock of sheep to higher ground above the river. If the river flooded, they should be safe there.  \n    In the meantime, my father was mending a shed roof that had partly fallen down after many years of fine service. If the tin flew off, it could damage the house. My younger brother began hurriedly carrying firewood under the shelter. My job was to help Mum board up the windows. If the storm developed into a cyclone (旋风), the boards would protect the glass.\n    The storm raged for four hours, pouring more rain on us than we had seen in the last five years. As expected, the river broke its banks and came slowly up towards the house and the stock.  \nThen, just as we were beginning to lose hope, the storm stopped as suddenly as it had begun. The animals were safe, and the roof was still nailed on. “All's well that ends well,” said my mother.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"stock","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"06 江西阅读A","sub":"[{\"id\":2973,\"main_id\":15022,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"When the black clouds appeared suddenly in the distance, __________.\",\"answer\":\"A. the family were surprised\",\"answer_a\":\"A. the family were surprised\",\"answer_b\":\"B. they were extremely worried\",\"answer_c\":\"C. they were preparing for the worst\",\"answer_d\":\"D. they faced the storm bravely\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p>1.

Silences may be thoughtful, or they may be empty when a person has nothing to say. A silence in a conversation may also show stubbornness, uneasiness, or worry. Silence may be viewed by some cultural groups as extremely uncomfortable; therefore attempts may be made to fill every gap (间隙) with conversation. Persons in other cultural groups value silence and view it as necessary for understanding a person's needs. \n    Many Native Americans value silence and feel it is a basic part of communicating among people, just as some traditional Chinese and Thai persons do. Therefore, when a person from one of these cultures is speaking and suddenly stops, what may be implied (暗示) is that the person wants the listener to consider what has been said before continuing. In these cultures, silence is a call for reflection. \n    Other cultures may use silence in other ways, particularly when dealing with conflicts among people or in relationships of people with different amounts of power. For example, Russian, French, and Spanish persons may use silence to show agreement between parties about the topic under discussion. However, Mexicans may use silence when instructions are given by a person in authority rather than be rude to that person by arguing with him or her. In still another use, persons in Asian cultures may view silence as a sign of respect, particularly to an elder or a person in authority. \n    Nurses and other care-givers need to be aware of the possible meanings of silence when they come across the personal anxiety their patients may be experiencing. Nurses should recognize their own personal and cultural construction of silence so that a patient's silence is not interrupted too early or allowed to go on unnecessarily. A nurse who understands the healing (治愈) value of silence can use this understanding to assist in the care of patients from their own and from other cultures.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"16 全国卷I阅读D篇","sub":"[{\"id\":2969,\"main_id\":15060,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What does the author say about silence in conversations?\",\"answer\":\"C.

The event is known as D-Day. It was the beginning of a campaign by the United States and its allies to end the German occupation of Europe. D-Day was a turning point in World War II.\n    By the end of 1943, the German military had suffered defeats and was weakened. But it was still powerful enough to control France, Belgium, and much of the rest of Western Europe. \n    The time had come for the United States and its Allies to liberate the continent. The German leader Adolf Hitler had known an invasion was coming. But he did not know where the Allied force would strike. Most Germans expected the Allies would attack at Calais, in northern France. But they were wrong. The Supreme Allied Commander, American General Dwight Eisenhower planned to attack Normandy, across the English Channel.\n    General Eisenhower had 150,000 men and 12,000 airplanes for the attack. But most importantly, he had surprise on his side. Even after the invasion began, General Erwin Rommel and other German military leaders could not believe that the Allies had really attacked at Normandy. But attack they did. On the night of June 5th, tens of thousands of Allied soldiers parachuted (伞降) behind German lines. Then, Allied planes began dropping bombs on German defenses. And in the morning, thousands of ships approached the coastline, carrying men and supplies.\n    The battle quickly became fierce and bloody. American, British and other Allied forces moved on five beaches from their landing craft. The Germans had strong defenses. They were better-protected than the Allied troops on the open beaches. But the Allies had more troops.\n    On all but one of those areas, German resistance was lighter than expected. At Omaha Beach, two American divisions (师) were slowed by the rising tide and heavy German gunfire. It was the fiercest and bloodiest battle of D-Day.\n    The Battle of Normandy continued through August, as Allied troops fought the Germans through France. In less than four months, General Eisenhower and the Allied forces had regained almost all of France. More than 400,000 Allied and German troops were wounded, killed or missing in action.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"landing craft","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"阅读6+1 高考A版 第6周 Monday","sub":"[{\"id\":2965,\"main_id\":15084,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"The invasion of Normandy __________.\",\"answer\":\"B. surprised many German military leaders\",\"answer_a\":\"A. was directed by a French general\",\"answer_b\":\"B. surprised many German military leaders\",\"answer_c\":\"C. lasted more than four months\",\"answer_d\":\"D. liberated the whole Western Europe\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p>1.

Here we help with ways to cut your costs.\n    AVOID BIG EVENTS Big sporting events, concerts and exhibitions can increase the cost of accommodation and make it harder to find a room. A standard double room at the Thistle Brighton on the final Friday of the Brighton Comedy Festival (19 Oct.) cost £169.15 at Booking.com. A week later, the same room cost £118.15.\n    If you can be flexible and want to know dates to avoid — or you're looking for a big event to pass your time — check out sites such as Whatsonwhen.com, which allow you to search for events in the UK by city, date and category.\n    STAY AWAY FROM THE STATION If traveling to your destination by train, you may want to find a good base close to the station, but you could end up paying more for the sake of convenience at the start of your holiday.\n    Don't be too choosy about the part of town you stay in. Booking two months in advance, the cheapest room at Travelodge's Central Euston hotel in London for Saturday 22 September was £95.95. A room just a tube journey away at its Covent Garden hotel was £75.75. And at Farringdon, a double room cost just £62.95. \n    LOOK AFTER YOURSELF Really central hotels in cities such as London, Edinburgh and Cardiff can cost a fortune, especially at weekends and during big events.

The basic reason is that these are the channels through which we keep contact with the surroundings. Though apparently it may feel like these are individual sensory organs, they do show some connectivity. Interestingly, our hearing is less sharp after we eat a heavy food. Isn't it good for a sound nap after a stomach-full meal? That does not mean we go deaf after a meal, but the hearing pitch (强度) does change after a heavy meal.\n    We usually give credit of the taste to our tongue, but do you know that unless saliva (唾液) dissolves something, our tongue cannot recognize the taste of the food eaten. Taste is nothing but the food chemicals dissolved in the saliva being sensed by the taste buds present on the tongue. Try to dry off your tongue and mouth with a tissue paper and then taste something.\n    Women are much better smellers than men. They are born with this characteristic ability and can correctly tell the exact fragrance of the sample. We all can store almost 50,000 different scents (气味), which are strongly tied to the memories.\n    Pupils (瞳孔) do not respond to light alone, but to the slightest bit of noise around too. Thus surgeons, watchmakers and those professionals who have to perform a much delicate job do prefer to have a sound-free environment. Even a small noise can dilate (扩大) their pupils, change the focus and blur (使模糊) their vision. If you do not wear glasses or contact lens due to having a 6/6 vision, you are just among the one third of the human population. It is now statistically proved that only one third of the population has perfect vision, and the rest are either wearing glasses or are trying to read with a compromised vision.\n    Each and every one of us has a particular or individualistic or characteristic smell, which is unique to us, except for twins. This smell is very subtle (微妙的) yet can be sensed even by a newborn. It may be due to this scent that the newborn recognizes the presence of his parents around. Many of us can tell the smell of our significant friends and colleagues. A significant part of this phenomenon is guided by genetics but it is also modified by the environment, diet and personal hygiene. This all together creates the unique chemistry that is individualistic for each person.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"Try to dry off your tongue and mouth with a tissue paper and then taste something","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p><span style=\"font-family: 宋体; font-size: 14px;\">本文是一篇说明文，介绍了我们的感觉器官的各种功能。</span></p>","source":"阅读6+1 高考A版 第19周 Tuesday","sub":"[{\"id\":2955,\"main_id\":15116,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"We can learn from the first paragraph that __________.\",\"answer\":\"D. we feel and learn about the world around us through our sensory organs\",\"answer_a\":\"A. our hearing is as good as before we have a full meal\",\"answer_b\":\"B. all sensory organs are connected and can be exchanged\",\"answer_c\":\"C. sensory organs’ functions can never be changed for their particular character\",\"answer_d\":\"D. we feel and learn about the world around us through our sensory organs\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p>1.
