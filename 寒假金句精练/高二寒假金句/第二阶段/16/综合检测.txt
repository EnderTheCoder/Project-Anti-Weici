题目:                    Never before had a Kitchen so much of a History
    It tells of Freedom, Success, and of the Architecture of big American cities. Because that is where it started: in the second half of the 19th century!
Welcome to a new Era of Kitchen Interior (室内的) Design
    Back then, a Generation of successful American Entrepreneurs (企业家) dreamt of a new style of
architecture to express their personal wealth. This dream was realized by young architects such as Daniel Burnham and Stanford White. They all had studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. And they created a new style for Architecture and Interior Design, named after the famous French Art Institute: Beaux-Arts.
SieMatic BeauxArts Breaks and Creates
  In fact it was not a new style at all, but a composition of styles from different periods and cultures. Many world-famous structures (建筑物) such as the Chicago Art Institute and the Statue of Liberty account for it. But what does that have to do with your kitchen? Just as much as you want it to. Because in the same way that the anti-conventional architects back then took the freedom to combine elements from different historical eras, today, you too can break the conventional rules of style and create something new: your own personal composition of your kitchen. For that, SieMatic BeauxArts offers unique opportunities: A broad range of seemingly conflicting features (特征) that you combine to a harmonious design of your own. You can choose from menu of various forms, appealing colors, and precious materials, to create an environment that is much more than just a kitchen: a reflection of your personality.
