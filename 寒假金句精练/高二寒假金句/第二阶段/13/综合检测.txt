题目:    Life can be so wonderful, full of adventure and joy. It can also be full of challenges, setbacks (挫折) and heartbreaks. Whatever our circumstances, we generally still have dreams, hopes and desires — that little something more we want for ourselves and our loved ones. ①Yet knowing we can have more can also create a problem, because when we go to change the way we do things, up come the old patterns and pitfalls (陷阱) that stopped us from seeking what we wanted in the first place.
    This tension between what we feel we can have and what we're seemingly able to have is the niggling (烦人的) suffering, the anxiety we feel. This is where we usually think it's easier to just give up. But we're never meant to let go of the part of us that knows we can have more. The intelligence behind that knowing is us — the real us. It's the part that believes in life and its possibilities. If you drop that, you begin to feel a little “dead” inside because you're dropping “you”.
    So, if we have this capability (能力) but somehow life seems to keep us stuck, how do we break these patterns?
    Decide on a new course and make one decision at a time. This is good advice for a new adventure or just getting through today's challenges.
    ②While, deep down, we know we can do it, our mind — or the minds of those close to us — usually says we can't. That isn't a reason to stop, it's just the mind, that little man or woman on your shoulder, trying to talk you out of something again. It has done it many times before. It's all about starting simple and doing it now.
    Decide and act before overthinking. When you do this you may feel a little, or large, release from the jail of your mind and you'll be on your way.
