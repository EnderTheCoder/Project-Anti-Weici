题目:    The inventor of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee, has won an important award which comes with a prize bag of one million euros (￡671,000). The “Father of the Web” was named as the first winner of the Millennium Technology Prize by the Finnish Technology Award Foundation. He said he had just been “in the right place at the right time” and did not want his photo taken. 
    In 1991, he came up with a system to organize, link and browse (浏览) Net pages which revolutionized the Internet. The British scientist was knighted (封爵士) for his pioneering work in 2003. 
    Sir Tim created his program while he was at the particle physics institute (粒子物理研究院), Cern, in Geneva. The computer code he came up with let scientists easily share research findings across a computer network. In the early 1990s, it was called the “world wide web”, and is still the basis of the web as we know it. 
    The famous man never went on to commercialize his work. Instead he worked on expanding the use of the Net as a channel for free expression and cooperation. 
    "The web is encouraging new types of social networks and opening up new ways for information management and business development. The web has obviously improved many people's ability to obtain information central to their lives,” said Pekka Tarjanne, chairman of the Millennium Technology Prize award committee. 
    Just under 80 people from 22 countries were nominated (提名) for the prize for their work in the areas of health, communication, new materials and the environment. 
    The Millennium Technology Prize was set up by the Finnish Technology Award Foundation, an independent body backed by the public and private money which aims to recognize outstanding creations. 
    Sir Tim currently heads up the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, where he is now based as an academic.
