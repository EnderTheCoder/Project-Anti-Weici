题目:    The English language is changing, and you are responsible! Whether we consider changes in grammar, spelling, pronunciation, or the very vocabulary of the language, you have played your part and continue to do so.
    When we first learned basic grammar and spelling, perhaps in elementary school, we might have gotten the impression that these things were sacred. The rules that apply to such things might have been presented as unchanging and unchangeable. While this approach might be beneficial for teaching children, it is far from accurate.
    The English language, like many others, is a living and growing thing. Like it or not, you are involved in this change. These changes take many forms. Grammar and spelling have changed radically (根本地) over the years and centuries, with the spelling differences in different countries today a reflection of this. While the language of a thousand years ago might be called English, most of us would hardly recognize it today as the same language.
    The first involves changes in the pronunciation of words. Many are familiar with the differences between the British and American ways of pronouncing certain words. In addition to these differences, the pronunciation of many words has changed over the years because of how you have decided to pronounce them. For example, consider the word “err”. The traditional pronunciation of this word rhymes with the word “her”. Older dictionaries show this to be the primary or only pronunciation. However in recent years, more and more people have been pronouncing it so that it sounds like “air”. Another change in the language involves the addition and removal of words. The makers of dictionaries decide which words deserve to be officially adopted as part of the English language. Through the centuries, many words have come from other languages. In fact, English has probably done this more than any other language in the world, which is why spelling and pronunciation rules for English have so many exceptions. 
    Of course many slang (俚语) words have been just short-lived craze (风行一时的东西) that have died out quickly. Others, though, have been adopted by mainstream society and become respectable, as have many technical terms. So then remember, the next time you repeat the newest expression to hit the streets, or make up your own words, you may be contributing to the future of the English language.
