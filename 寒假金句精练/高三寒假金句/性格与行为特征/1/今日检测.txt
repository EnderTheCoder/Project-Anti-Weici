题目:In a national spelling contest in America, an 11–year–old girl was asked to spell a certain word. But with her ### voice the judges were not sure if she spelled the word with the letter A or E. They talked it over and ### decided to simply ask her what she had said. By now, the girl knew she had ### the word. But instead of lying, she told the truth that she had said the ### letter — so she lost the contest.    
As the girl walked off the ###, the entire audience stood to their feet clapping to applaud her ###. Later, dozens of newspaper reporters wrote about this 11– year–old girl's honesty, even when ### it her the contest. But the fact is that she ### the biggest contest that day: the contest of her ###.   
Probably the biggest test of our character and honesty is what we would do if we knew we would never get ###. This young girl could easily have ### and nobody would have known it but herself. But that's just it: She would know she did wrong. It's been said, “If you ###, you make yourself cheap.” This young girl was strong and smart enough to prize her own ### and character more than the prize from a spelling ###. Her respect for herself was more important than any ### others might give her for winning a contest. She knew she would have to live with herself and the ### she made in that moment will have long–lasting influence.    
It's so true that the choices you make today ### what you are tomorrow. Our children will ### our behavior much more than our advice. So if we want them to ### to be honest, we must show them the way by being honest ourselves. Remember, our kids are ### what we do and how we live even when we don't think they see or know.
