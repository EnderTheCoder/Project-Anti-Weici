Noah's Ark is aimed at collecting eggs, embryos (胚胎), semen and DNA of endangered animals and storing them in liquid nitrogen(氮). If certain species should become extinct, Dr. Duane Kraemer, a professor in Texas A&M's College of Veterinary Medicine, says there would be enough of the basic building blocks to reintroduce the species in the future.        It is estimated that as many as 2,000 species will become extinct in 100 years. The panda, native only to China, is in danger of dying out in the next 25 years.        This week, Chinese scientists said they grew an embryo by introducing cells from a dead female panda into the egg cells of a Japanese white rabbit. They are now trying to implant the embryo into a host animal (受体动物).        The entire procedure could take from three to five years to complete.        “The nuclear transfer of one species to another is not easy, and the lack of available panda eggs could be a major problem,” Kraemer believes. “They will probably have to do several hundred transfers to result in one pregnancy. It takes a long time and it's difficult, but this could be groundbreaking science if it works. They are certainly not putting any live pandas at risk, so it is worth the effort,” adds Kraemer, who is one of the leaders of the Project at Texas A&M, the first-ever attempt at cloning a dog.        “They are trying to do something that's never been done, and this is very similar to our work in Noah's Ark. We're both trying to save animals that face extinction. I certainly appreciate their effort and there's a lot we can learn from what they are attempting to do.

Economics deals with this problem through the concept of opportunity cost, which simply refers to whether someone's time or money could be better spent on something else.       Every hour of our time has a value. For every hour we work at one job we could quite easily be doing another, or be sleeping or watching a film. Each of these options (选择) has a different opportunity cost — namely, what they cost us in missed opportunities.       Say you intend to watch a football match but the tickets are expensive and it will take you a couple of hours to get to and from the stadium. Why not, you might reason, watch the game from home and use the leftover money and time to have dinner with friends? This — the alternative use of your cash and time — is the opportunity cost.       For economists, every decision is made by knowledge of what one must forgo — in terms of money and enjoyment — in order to take it up. By knowing precisely what you are receiving and what you are missing out on, you ought to be able to make better-informed, more reasonable decisions. Consider that most famous economic rule of all: there's no such thing as a free lunch. Even if someone offers to take you out to lunch for free, the time you will spend in the restaurant still costs you something in terms of forgone opportunities.       Some people find the idea of opportunity cost extremely discouraging: imagine spending your entire life calculating whether your time would be better spent elsewhere doing something more profitable or enjoyable. Yet, in a sense it's human nature to do precisely that —we assess the advantages and disadvantages of decisions all the time.       In the business world, a popular phrase is “value for money.” People want their cash to go as far as possible. However, another is fast obtaining an advantage: “value for time.” The biggest restriction on our resources (资源) is the number of hours we can devote to something, so we look to maximize the return we get on our investment of time. By reading this passage you are giving over a bit of your time which could be spent doing other activities, such as sleeping and eating. In return, however, this passage will help you to think like an economist, closely considering the opportunity cost of each of your decisions.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"拓展阅读Unit 31 G篇","sub":"[{\"id\":5327,\"main_id\":49585,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"According to the passage, the concept of “opportunity cost” is applied to________.\",\"answer\":\"D. weighing the choice of opportunities\",\"answer_a\":\"A. making more money\",\"answer_b\":\"B. taking more opportunities\",\"answer_c\":\"C. reducing missed opportunities\",\"answer_d\":\"D. weighing the choice of opportunities\",\"highlight\":\"opportunity cost\",\"analysis\":\"<p>1.

Their efforts have been proven fruitful. Wang Shu, a 49-year-old Chinese architect, won the 2012 Pritzker Architecture Prize — which is often referred to as the Nobel Prize in architecture — on February 28. He is the first Chinese citizen to win this award.        Wang serves as head of the Architecture Department at the China Academy of Art (CAA). His office is located at the Xiangshan campus (校园) of the university in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. Many buildings on the campus are his original creations.       The style of the campus is quite different from that of most Chinese universities. Many visitors were amazed by the complex architectural space and abundant building types. The curves (曲线) of the buildings perfectly match the rise and fall of hills, forming a unique view.       Wang collected more than 7 million abandoned bricks of different ages. He asked the workers to use traditional techniques to make the bricks into walls, roofs and corridors. This creation attracted a lot of attention thanks to its mixture of modern and traditional Chinese elements (元素) .        Wang's works show a deep understanding of modern architecture and a good knowledge of traditions. Through such a balance, he had created a new type of Chinese architecture, said Tadao Ando, the winner of the 1995 Pritzker Prize.       Wang believes traditions should not be sealed in glass boxes at museums. “That is only evidence that traditions once existed,” he said.“Many Chinese people have a misunderstanding of traditions. They think tradition means old things from the past. In fact, tradition also refers to the things that have been developing and that are still being created,” he said.       “Today, many Chinese people are learning Western styles and theories rather than focusing on Chinese traditions. Many people tend to talk about traditions without knowing what they really are,” said Wang.       The study of traditions should be combined with practice.
