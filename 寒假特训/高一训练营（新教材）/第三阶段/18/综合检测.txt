题目:        In 2010, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) issued bad news: The world tiger population had hit an all-time low. Poaching (偷猎) and habitat loss had taken their toll (伤亡). There were just 3,200 tigers left in the wild, about half as many as there had been a decade before.        Now there's good news: Tigers could be making a comeback. There are currently about 4,000 tigers worldwide. In July, India announced that its tiger population had reached nearly 3,000.        At a press conference in July, India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, spoke about the country's renewed efforts to save tigers. “Once the people of India decide to do something,” he said, “there is no force that can prevent them from getting the desired results.”        India's success was years in the making. Since its Wildlife Protection Act became law, in 1972, India has given tigers a high level of protection. Still, by 2006, habitat loss had brought the number of India's tigers to just 1,411.        In 2010, 13 countries where tigers live made a promise to double their tiger populations by 2022. India is on track to reach that goal. The animal's fate depends on other countries reaching it too.        India's latest tiger count was the work of thousands of wildlife trackers and scientists. They covered 150,000 square miles of tiger habitat, using thousands of cameras to record the animal's movements. This data has helped India create areas called reserves, where tigers can spread out and hunt.        It's when the big cats wander off reserves that trouble starts. When tigers leave protected areas, they often encounter (遇到) people and livestock (家畜). India's government has been moving villages away from reserves — to protect livestock from hungry tigers, and to prevent villagers from killing tigers out of fear or for revenge.        But challenges remain for tigers all over Asia. “They're still in danger,” wildlife expert Rodriguez says. She draws hope from India's success: “This is a small, small victory in a long war against extinction.”
