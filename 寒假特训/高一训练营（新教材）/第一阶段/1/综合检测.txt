题目:理解文中具体信息        I work with Volunteers for Wildlife, a rescue and education organization at Bailey Arboretum in Locust Valley. Trying to help injured, displaced or sick creatures can be heartbreaking; survival is never certain. However, when it works, it is simply beautiful. I got a rescue call from a woman in Muttontown. She had found a young owl (猫头鹰) on the ground. When I arrived, I saw a 2-to 3-week-old owl. It had already been placed in a carrier for safety. I examined the young owl and it seemed fine. If I could locate the nest, I might have been able to put it back, but no luck. My next work was to build a nest and fix it in a tree.
