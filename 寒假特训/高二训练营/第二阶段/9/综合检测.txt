题目:根据上下文推断单词和短语的意义                Money with no strings attached. It’s not something you see every day. But at Union Station in Los Angeles last month, a board went up with dollar bills attached to it with pins and a sign that read, “Give What You Can, Take What You Need.”        People quickly caught on. And while many took dollars, many others pinned their own cash to the board. “People of all ages, races, and socio-economic (社会经济的) backgrounds gave and took,” said Tyler Bridges of The Toolbox, which created the project. “We even had a bride in her wedding dress come up to the board and take a few dollars. ” Most of the bills on the board were singles, but a few people left fives, tens and even twenties. The video clip (片段) shows one man who had found a $ 20 bill pinning it to the board.

题目:根据上下文推断单词和短语的意义      “It’s no secret that China has always been a source of inspiration for designers,” says Amanda Hill, chief creative officer at A+E Networks, a global media company and home to some of the biggest fashion shows. “Chinese models are the faces of beauty and fashion campaigns that sell dreams to women all over the world, which means Chinese women are not just consumers of fashion — they are central to its movement.” Of course, not only are today’s top Western designers being influenced by China — some of the best designers of contemporary fashion are themselves Chinese. “Vera Wang, Alexander Wang, Jason Wu are taking on Galliano, Albaz, Marc Jacobs — and beating them hands down in design and sales,” adds Hill.

题目:作出判断和推理        Is there a link between humans and climate change or not? This question was first studied in the early 1900s. Since then, many scientists have thought that our actions do make a difference. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol explained our role in the Earth’s changing atmosphere (大气层) and set international limits for gas emissions (排放) from 2008 to 2012. Some countries have decided to continue these reductions until 2020. More recently, the Paris Agreement, struck by nearly 200 countries, also aims to limit global warming. But just how much warmer it will get depends on how deeply countries cut carbon emissions.
