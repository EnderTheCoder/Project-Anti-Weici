题目:观点态度        I must have always known reading was very important because the first memories I have as a child deal with books. There was not one night that I don’t remember mom reading me a storybook by my bedside. I was extremely inspired by the elegant way the words sounded.        Most of my reading through primary, middle and high school was factual reading. I read for knowledge, and to make A’s on my tests. Occasionally, I would read a novel that was assigned (指定), but I didn’t enjoy this type of reading. I liked facts, things that are concrete (具体的). I thought anything abstract left too much room for argument.

题目:段落大意        By the end of the century, if not sooner, the world’s oceans will be bluer and greener thanks to a warming climate, according to a new study.        At the heart of the phenomenon lie tiny marine microorganisms (海洋微生物) called phytoplankton. Because of the way light reflects off the organisms, these phytoplankton create colourful patterns at the ocean surface. Ocean colour varies from green to blue, depending on the type and concentration of phytoplankton. Climate change will fuel the growth of phytoplankton in some areas, while reducing it in other spots, leading to changes in the ocean’s appearance.

题目:段落大意        California has lost half its big trees since the 1930s, according to a study to be published Tuesday and climate change seems to be a major factor (因素).        The number of trees larger than two feet across has decreased by 50 percent on more than 46,000 square miles of California forests, the new study finds. No area was spared or unaffected, from the foggy northern coast to the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the San Gabriels above Los Angeles. In the Sierra high country, the number of big trees has fallen by more than 55 percent; in parts of southern California the decrease was nearly 75 percent.
