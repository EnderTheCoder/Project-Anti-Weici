题目:        Vincent Willem van Gogh is a well-known Dutch post-Impressionist painter. During his lifetime, Van Gogh remained poor and unknown.Early life        Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, to upper middle class parents. He spent his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers before traveling to The Hague, London and Paris.        He became a teacher in England and then he worked as a missionary (传教士) in a mining region in Belgium where he sketched (画素描) people from the local community, and in 1885 painted his first major work The Potato Eaters. The main colors of his paintings then consisted mainly of dark earth tones and showed no sign of the vivid coloration that distinguished his later paintings.France        In March 1886, he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists. He met many artists including Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, Pissarro and Gauguin, with whom he became friends. Later, he moved to the south of France and was influenced by the region’s strong sunlight. His paintings grew brighter in color, and he developed the unique and highly recognizable style that became fully realized during his stay in Arles in 1888.        Van Gogh invited Gauguin to join him in Arles, but their relationship began to become worse. Van Gogh admired Gauguin and desperately wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant (傲慢的). They quarreled about art; Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him, and the situation, rapidly headed towards a crisis point. Deeply guilty, he then cut off part of his own ear.Mental illness        This incident was the first serious sign of the mental health problems that were to affect Van Gogh for the remaining days of his life. He spent time in mental hospitals and swung between periods of  depression and incredibly concentrated artistic activity. His work reflected the intense colours and strong light of the countryside around him. On May 9, 1889, he asked to be admitted to the mental hospital at Saint-Rémy-de Provence. In the year Van Gogh spent there he worked as much as he had at Arles, producing 150 paintings and hundreds of drawings.Death        Van Gogh went to Paris on May 17, 1890, to visit his brother, Theo. On the advice of Pissarro, Theo had Vincent go to Auvers, just outside Paris. At first, Van Gogh felt relieved at Auvers, but toward the end of June he experienced fits of temper (坏脾气). On July 27, 1890, he shot himself in a lonely field and died, two days later, in the morning of July 29, 1890.
