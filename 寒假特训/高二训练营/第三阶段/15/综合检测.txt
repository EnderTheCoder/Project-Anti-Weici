题目:        In this age of texts and tweets (短信和推特), it is easy to send messages. You just press a few buttons, and boom! Your message is sent. The person to whom you sent it will get it in just a few seconds. Distance is no longer an issue.       In 1848 gold was found in California. Thousands of people rushed there to get some. Many people liked living there and decided to stay. But there wasn’t a whole lot between California and Missouri, where the nearest trains ran. The train line to California wasn’t finished until 1869.       Imagine that it is the year 1860. You have moved to California to open a shop. Most of your family stayed back East. Your shop is doing well and now you want to your family to join you. How do you get news to them? There's no phone, no train, and you can't leave your shop for too long. Well, you could use the Pony Express.       In 1860 and 1861, the Pony Express was the fastest way to get news to and from the West. The trail that they rode was around 2000 miles long. It took most people weeks or months to ride that far. The Pony Express could make the trip in just ten days. Those speeds were unheard of at the time. So how did they do it? Well, they had a good system.        The Pony Express had 184 stations along the trail. The stations were around ten miles apart. The rider would change to a new horse at each station. Every 75-100 miles, the rider would get to a home station. At each home station, riders would rest. Before resting, he would give his mail pouch (邮袋) to a new rider.        It was tough to ride for the Pony Express. Each rider had to weigh less than 125 pounds. Speed was the key. They rode at a fast pace for up to 100 miles a day. If there were an emergency, one might have to ride 200 miles in a day.       The Pony Express filled an important role for a time, but it did not last. On October 24th, 1861, the first telegraph (电报) line to California was finished. This linked them to the rest of the country. People could send messages in an instant. Two days later the Pony Express closed. But the lore (传说) of the brave riders lives on even today.
