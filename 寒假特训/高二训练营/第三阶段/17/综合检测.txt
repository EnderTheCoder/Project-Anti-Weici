题目:        Archimedes was born in about 287 BCE, in Syracuse, Sicily, Italy. He is one of the most famous scientists of that period, and his work is still known today. During his life, Archimedes was close to the king, Hieron II. He also communicated frequently with other known scholars (学者) of that time.        Stories of Archimedes’ life suggest that he was known as somewhat of a genius, especially for mechanics (力学) and engineering. There are stories that are likely true, such as Archimedes determining how much gold and silver was in King Hieron’s wreath (皇冠) by weighing the wreath in the water. But then there are stories that are likely untrue, such as Archimedes running out of the bath into the streets when he figured out how he could measure the water levels in the bath.        He was known for having interest in the reflection of light in mirrors, and how it could change based on the curves (弯曲) of the mirror. He also focused his work on mathematics and mechanics, or engineering.        Archimedes wrote papers on theoretical mechanics, including his work Method Concerning Mechanical Theorems. He used these theories to help him work on what he really appreciated: mathematical formulas (公式) and theories.        Archimedes is famous for having published nine books on mathematics. His book On the Sphere and Cylinder contains some of his mathematical formulas. Another book he published, Measurement of the Circle, contains more mathematical formulas that he discovered. This one includes formulas involving the measurement of circles in relation to the mathematical constant (常数), pi (3.14). This second book also includes information about irregular shapes, and how measurement can be calculated for them, even with the so many sides to their shapes. His next book, On Conoids and Spheroids, describes how to measure the volume of cones (圆锥体) and different parts of cones        Unfortunately, due to the long passage of time since Archimedes’ lifetime, many of his books did not last, and we do not have them. It is said that Archimedes died helping to protect his city  when the Romans invaded (侵犯) Sicily, in possibly 212 or 211 BCE.
