题目:         Hospital stays can be frightening, especially for children. They find themselves in a strange place, often surrounded by wires, beeping machines and strange-looking bags of intravenous (IV) fluids (静脉输液). But what if that IV pole smiled back in a familiar and comforting way?        It’s the inspiration that led 12-year-old Ella Casano to found Medi Teddy, a successful GoFundMe campaign to produce and distribute teddy bear covers for IV bags. At 7, Casano was diagnosed with a rare disease that required frequent IV infusions (注射). Over the past five years, she spent one day every eight weeks hooked (钩体) up to an IV that delivered her treatment.      “When I had my first infusion, I was surprised and a little bit frightened by the amount of tubing and medical equipment on my IV pole,” Casano explains on her website. She decided to help other kids deal with their fears of medical treatments, starting with that IV bag.        The product didn’t come to life overnight. First, she experimented by cutting one of her teddy bear toys. She removed some of the filling and added both a hook to the top of the head and a pocket in the back. Her first attempt was good, but not quite right. She made several other prototypes (雏形). After each version, she asked her nurses for feedback (反馈意见). Soon, she perfected her design.        Ella’s mother, Meg, loved the idea of Medi Teddy and encouraged her daughter to keep working on it. “It took her two years to research and write a business plan, make a marketing video, and learn how to build a website,” she said.Ella Casano embraced both the fun and the dull tasks that go along with starting a business. She sat in on conference calls, found a company to produce a prototype and even read through legal documents. All that was left to do was raise money. In June, she published her GoFundMe page and quickly passed her goal of $5,000. Within two weeks, she raised over $22,000.        The first shipment of Medi Teddy IV covers is expected to arrive by fall 2019. The Casano family looks forward to seeing Ella’s creation in the hands of every child who wants one.
