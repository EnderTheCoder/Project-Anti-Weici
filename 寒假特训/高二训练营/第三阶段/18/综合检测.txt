题目:        Rats have mastered the art of driving a tiny car, suggesting their brains are more flexible (灵活的) than we thought. The finding could be used to understand how learning new skills reduces stress. Lambert and her colleagues at the University of Richmond wondered if rats could learn the more complex task of operating a moving car.        They made a tiny car out of a clear plastic food box on wheels, with an metal floor and three copper bars working as a steering wheel (方向盘). When a rat stood on the metal floor and held the copper bars, they completed an electrical circuit (电路) that pushed the car forward. Touching the left, centre or right bar controlled them in different directions.        Six female and eleven male rats were trained to drive the car in arenas (场地) up to 4 square metres in size. This involved rewarding them with food when they touched the steering bars and drove the car forward.        The rats were encouraged to advance their driving skills by placing the food rewards at increasingly distant points around the arenas. “They learned to drive the car in unique ways,” says Lambert.        Learning to drive seemed to relax the rats. This finding echoes (呼应) Lambert’s previous work showing that rats become less stressed after they master difficult tasks like digging up buried food. They may get the same kind of satisfaction as we get when we perfect a new skill, she says. In support of this idea, the team found that rats that drove themselves were less stressed than rats that were driven around as passengers in remote-controlled cars.        The discovery that rats can drive cars shows the “neuroplasticity” (神经可塑性) of their brains, says Lambert. “I do believe that rats are smarter than we think,” she says.        Researchers could replace traditional tests with more complex driving tasks when using rat models to study neuropsychiatric conditions, says Lambert. “If we use more realistic and challenging models, it may provide more meaningful data,” she says.        The team is now planning follow-up experiments to understand how rats learn to drive, why it seems to reduce stress, and which brain areas are involved.
