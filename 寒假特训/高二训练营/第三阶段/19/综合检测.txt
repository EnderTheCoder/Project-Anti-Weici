题目:        On July 20, 1969, American astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin climbed down from the Apollo 11 lander and planted their boots on the lunar surface. The United States had beaten the Soviet Union, in the race to put humans on the moon.        Fifty years later, a new race is on. NASA is excited to get back to the moon. But now it has more competition and private companies are building rockets, too.        Why go back? There are fortunes to be made in lunar exploration. Space-based businesses add $350 billion to the world economy. Plus, the moon holds riches of its own. Minerals found there could be used in electronics manufacturing. Lunar ice could be turned into oxygen for visiting astronauts. Combine that oxygen with hydrogen, and you get clean rocket fuel. Ships could fill their tanks on the moon before taking off for more distant places, such as Mars.        NASA is building its most powerful rocket ever, the Space Launch System. It will carry a craft (飞行器) called Orion (猎户座) to the Gateway orbiter (轨道飞行器). From there, crews will take a lander on trips to the moon’s surface. NASA’s budget is around $20 billion.         The company, SpaceX, expects to send people to the International Space Station next year. In 2021, it plans to launch Starship, a moon orbiter with room for 100 passengers. Instead of just visiting the moon, SpaceX’s founder, billionaire Elon Musk, imagines a permanent lunar base. Still, Musk knows he has big historical boots to fill. “Apollo 11 was one of the most inspiring things in all human history,” he says. “I’m not sure SpaceX would exist if not for Apollo 11.”        Think of Gateway as a base camp for exploring the moon. Though it will serve as a home for several astronauts, it will be no bigger than a small apartment. It will travel in an egg-shaped orbit around the moon. Astronauts will position Gateway over the spot they want to explore, then take a lander down to the lunar surface.The space agency is eager to get Gateway built by 2024. It will allow people to explore more of the moon than they ever could on the Apollo missions.
