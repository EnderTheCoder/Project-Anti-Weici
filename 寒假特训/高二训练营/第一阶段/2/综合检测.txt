题目:理解文中具体信息        I had one trip last year where I was caught by a hurricane (飓风) in America. I picked up the stem cells (干细胞) in Providence, Rhode Island, and was meant to fly to Washington then back to London. But when I arrived at the check-in desk at Providence, the lady on the desk said: “Well, I’m really sorry, I’ve got some bad news for you — there are no flights from Washington.” So I took my box and put it on the desk and I said: “In this box are some stem cells that are urgently (紧迫地) needed for a patient — please, please, you’ve got to get me back to the United Kingdom.” She just dropped everything. She arranged for a flight on a small plane to be held for me, re-routed (改道) me through Newark and got me back to the UK even earlier than originally scheduled.
