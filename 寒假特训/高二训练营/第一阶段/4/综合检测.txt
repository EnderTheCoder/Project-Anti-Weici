题目:理解文中具体信息        Lead poisoning (铅中毒) has proved more difficult to deal with. When condors (秃鹰) eat dead bodies of other animals containing lead, they absorb large quantities of lead. This affects their nervous systems and ability to produce baby birds, and can lead to kidney (肾) failure and death. So condors with high levels of lead are sent to Los Angeles Zoo, where they are treated with calcium EDTA, a chemical that removes lead from the blood over several days. This work is starting to pay off. The annual (每年的) death rate for adult condors has dropped from 38% in 2000 to 5.4% in 2011.

题目:理解文中具体信息        Measles (麻疹), which once killed 450 children each year and disabled even more, was nearly wiped out in the United States 14 years ago by the universal use of the MMR vaccine (疫苗). But the illness is making a comeback, caused by a growing anti-vaccine (反对疫苗) movement and misinformation that is spreading quickly. Already this year, 115 measles cases have been reported in the USA, compared with 189 for all of last year. The numbers might sound small, but they are the leading edge of a dangerous trend.
