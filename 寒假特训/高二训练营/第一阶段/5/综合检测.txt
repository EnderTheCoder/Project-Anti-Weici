题目:理解文中具体信息        Before the 1830s, most newspapers were sold through annual subscriptions (年度订阅) in America, usually $8 to $10 a year. Today $8 or $10 seems a small amount of money, but at that time these amounts were forbidding (令人生畏的) to most citizens.

They were boring and visually forbidding. But the revolution that was taking place in the 1830s would change all that.
