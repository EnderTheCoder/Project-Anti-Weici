In 1860 and 1861, the Pony Express was the fastest way to get news to and from the West. The trail that they rode was around 2000 miles long. It took most people weeks or months to ride that far.

The Pony Express had 184 stations along the trail. The stations were around ten miles apart. The rider would change to a new horse at each station. Every 75-100 miles, the rider would get to a home station. At each home station, riders would rest. Before resting, he would give his mail pouch (邮袋) to a new rider.        It was tough to ride for the Pony Express. Each rider had to weigh less than 125 pounds. Speed was the key. They rode at a fast pace for up to 100 miles a day.

But what if that IV pole smiled back in a familiar and comforting way?        It’s the inspiration that led 12-year-old Ella Casano to found Medi Teddy, a successful GoFundMe campaign to produce and distribute teddy bear covers for IV bags. At 7, Casano was diagnosed with a rare disease that required frequent IV infusions (注射). Over the past five years, she spent one day every eight weeks hooked (钩体) up to an IV that delivered her treatment.      “When I had my first infusion, I was surprised and a little bit frightened by the amount of tubing and medical equipment on my IV pole,” Casano explains on her website. She decided to help other kids deal with their fears of medical treatments, starting with that IV bag.        The product didn’t come to life overnight. First, she experimented by cutting one of her teddy bear toys. She removed some of the filling and added both a hook to the top of the head and a pocket in the back. Her first attempt was good, but not quite right. She made several other prototypes (雏形). After each version, she asked her nurses for feedback (反馈意见). Soon, she perfected her design.        Ella’s mother, Meg, loved the idea of Medi Teddy and encouraged her daughter to keep working on it. “It took her two years to research and write a business plan, make a marketing video, and learn how to build a website,” she said.Ella Casano embraced both the fun and the dull tasks that go along with starting a business. She sat in on conference calls, found a company to produce a prototype and even read through legal documents. All that was left to do was raise money. In June, she published her GoFundMe page and quickly passed her goal of $5,000. Within two weeks, she raised over $22,000.

When a rat stood on the metal floor and held the copper bars, they completed an electrical circuit (电路) that pushed the car forward. Touching the left, centre or right bar controlled them in different directions.        Six female and eleven male rats were trained to drive the car in arenas (场地) up to 4 square metres in size. This involved rewarding them with food when they touched the steering bars and drove the car forward.        The rats were encouraged to advance their driving skills by placing the food rewards at increasingly distant points around the arenas. “They learned to drive the car in unique ways,” says Lambert.        Learning to drive seemed to relax the rats. This finding echoes (呼应) Lambert’s previous work showing that rats become less stressed after they master difficult tasks like digging up buried food. They may get the same kind of satisfaction as we get when we perfect a new skill, she says. In support of this idea, the team found that rats that drove themselves were less stressed than rats that were driven around as passengers in remote-controlled cars.        The discovery that rats can drive cars shows the “neuroplasticity” (神经可塑性) of their brains, says Lambert. “I do believe that rats are smarter than we think,” she says.        Researchers could replace traditional tests with more complex driving tasks when using rat models to study neuropsychiatric conditions, says Lambert. “If we use more realistic and challenging models, it may provide more meaningful data,” she says.        The team is now planning follow-up experiments to understand how rats learn to drive, why it seems to reduce stress, and which brain areas are involved.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p style=\"text-indent: 28px\"><span style=\";font-family: 宋体\">本文是一篇说明文。主要介绍了科学家用自制的微型汽车，通过一个训练老鼠开车的实验，证实了学习新技能可以减缓压力。</span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"阅读理解原创","sub":"[{\"id\":6470,\"main_id\":51873,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Rats have mastered the art of driving a tiny car, suggesting their brains are more flexible than we thought.（一词多义）\",\"answer\":\"B. 表明\",\"answer_a\":\"A. 暗示\",\"answer_b\":\"B. 表明\",\"answer_c\":\"C. 提议\",\"answer_d\":\"\",\"highlight\":\"suggesting\",\"analysis\":\"\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":6471,\"main_id\":51873,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"The rats were encouraged to advance their driving skills by placing the food rewards at increasingly distant points.（一词多义）\",\"answer\":\"C. 提升\",\"answer_a\":\"A. 展示\",\"answer_b\":\"B. 应用\",\"answer_c\":\"C. 提升\",\"answer_d\":\"\",\"highlight\":\"advance \",\"analysis\":\"\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":6472,\"main_id\":51873,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"In support of this idea, the team found that rats that drove themselves were less stressed than rats that were driven around as passengers in remote-controlled cars.（精准的汉语释义）\",\"answer\":\"B. 遥控的\",\"answer_a\":\"A. 远程协助的\",\"answer_b\":\"B. 遥控的\",\"answer_c\":\"C. 可控制的\",\"answer_d\":\"\",\"highlight\":\"remote-controlled \",\"analysis\":\"\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":6473,\"main_id\":51873,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"The team is now planning follow-up experiments to understand how rats learn to drive.（精准的汉语释义）\",\"answer\":\"A. 后续的\",\"answer_a\":\"A. 后续的\",\"answer_b\":\"B. 精确的\",\"answer_c\":\"C. 紧跟着的\",\"answer_d\":\"\",\"highlight\":\"follow-up\",\"analysis\":\"\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":6474,\"main_id\":51873,\"questions\":2,\"subject\":\"Researchers could ### traditional tests ### (用…替换) more complex driving tasks when using rat models to study neuropsychiatric conditions, says Lambert.

       Vincent Willem van Gogh is a well-known Dutch post-Impressionist painter. During his lifetime, Van Gogh remained poor and unknown.Early life        Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, to upper middle class parents. He spent his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers before traveling to The Hague, London and Paris.        He became a teacher in England and then he worked as a missionary (传教士) in a mining region in Belgium where he sketched (画素描) people from the local community, and in 1885 painted his first major work The Potato Eaters. The main colors of his paintings then consisted mainly of dark earth tones and showed no sign of the vivid coloration that distinguished his later paintings.France        In March 1886, he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists. He met many artists including Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, Pissarro and Gauguin, with whom he became friends. Later, he moved to the south of France and was influenced by the region’s strong sunlight. His paintings grew brighter in color, and he developed the unique and highly recognizable style that became fully realized during his stay in Arles in 1888.        Van Gogh invited Gauguin to join him in Arles, but their relationship began to become worse. Van Gogh admired Gauguin and desperately wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant (傲慢的). They quarreled about art; Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him, and the situation, rapidly headed towards a crisis point. Deeply guilty, he then cut off part of his own ear.Mental illness        This incident was the first serious sign of the mental health problems that were to affect Van Gogh for the remaining days of his life. He spent time in mental hospitals and swung between periods of  depression and incredibly concentrated artistic activity. His work reflected the intense colours and strong light of the countryside around him. On May 9, 1889, he asked to be admitted to the mental hospital at Saint-Rémy-de Provence. In the year Van Gogh spent there he worked as much as he had at Arles, producing 150 paintings and hundreds of drawings.Death        Van Gogh went to Paris on May 17, 1890, to visit his brother, Theo.

During his lifetime, Van Gogh remained poor and unknown.</p><p>Early life</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, to upper middle class parents. He spent his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers before traveling to The Hague, London and Paris.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He became a teacher in England and then he worked as a missionary (传教士) in a mining region in Belgium where he sketched (画素描) people from the local community, and in 1885 painted his first major work The Potato Eaters. The main colors of his paintings then consisted mainly of dark earth tones and showed no sign of the vivid coloration that distinguished his later paintings.</p><p>France</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In March 1886, he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists. He met many artists including Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, Pissarro and Gauguin, with whom he became friends. Later, he moved to the south of France and was influenced by the region’s strong sunlight. His paintings grew brighter in color, and he developed the unique and highly recognizable style that became fully realized during his stay in Arles in 1888.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Van Gogh invited Gauguin to join him in Arles, but their relationship began to become worse. Van Gogh admired Gauguin and desperately wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant (傲慢的). They quarreled about art; Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him, and the situation, rapidly headed towards <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 176, 80);\">a crisis</span> <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 176, 80);\">point</span>. Deeply guilty, he then cut off part of his own ear.</p><p>Mental illness</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This incident was the first serious sign of the mental health problems that were to affect Van Gogh for the remaining days of his life. He spent time in mental hospitals and swung between periods of&nbsp; depression and incredibly concentrated artistic activity. His work <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 176, 80);\">reflected</span> the intense colours and strong light of the countryside around him. On May 9, 1889, he asked to be <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 176, 80);\">admitted</span> to the mental hospital at Saint-Rémy-de Provence. In the year Van Gogh spent there he worked as much as he had at Arles, producing 150 paintings and hundreds of drawings.</p><p>Death</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Van Gogh went to Paris on May 17, 1890, to visit his brother, Theo. On the advice of Pissarro, Theo had Vincent go to Auvers, just outside Paris. At first, Van Gogh felt relieved at Auvers, but toward the end of June he experienced fits of temper (坏脾气).
