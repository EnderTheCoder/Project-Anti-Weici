题目:理解文中具体信息       The freezing Northeast hasn’t been a terribly fun place to spend time this winter, so when the chance came for a weekend to Sarasota, Florida, my bags were packed before you could say “sunshine.” I left for the land of warmth and vitamin C (维生素C), thinking of beaches and orange trees. When we touched down to blue skies and warm air, I sent up a small prayer (祈祷) of gratefulness. Swimming pools, wine tasting, and pink sunsets (at normal evening hours, not 4 in the afternoon) filled the weekend, but the best part — especially to my taste, dulled (使迟钝) by months of cold-weather root vegetables — was a 7 a.m. adventure to the Sarasota farmers’ market that proved to be more than worth the early wake-up call.
