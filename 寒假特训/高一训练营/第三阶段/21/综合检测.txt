题目:        When you think of researchers making new discoveries in the Amazon, what comes to your mind? Rare birds? Different insect species? All these can be found in the Amazon, but there's something else waiting there to be discovered too: some of the most unusual languages in the world.        Daniel Everett, a professor at Bentley University, was trying to learn the Pirahã language, which was a difficult task because none of the Pirahã, a riverbank-living native people, spoke English. Everett went to live among the Pirahã and learned the basics first: he pointed at objects until someone else named them for him. Then he repeated the sounds the speaker made until he got them right. Even as he picked up words, though, he realized that the Pirahã didn't consider him a true speaker of the language.        The Pirahã language is unusual in many ways. For one thing, it contains only about 11 different sounds. (In English, we use around 40). There is no writing system among the Pirahã. The language also has very few words for abstract (抽象的) ideas: they have no color words and no counting words, except for ideas like “a few” or “most”.        Another strange thing about the Pirahã language is that it doesn't include something called “recursion”. Recursion is when sentences have ideas nested (嵌套) inside one another. For example, if you say, “The boat that I like is on the river,” you are nesting together two separate thoughts about that boat: you like it, and it's on the river. That simple sentence is impossible to create in Pirahã! Instead, you would have to say something like, “I like the boat. The boat is on the river.”        And the Pirahã have even more interesting ways of speaking. For sound to carry far through thick jungle, the Pirahã may use two separate ways to communicate: whistle-speech and shouting-speech. They also use musical-speech while dancing or providing important information and humming-speech (哼唱语言) for private conversations or for speaking to children.        Despite the dangers of his environment and the challenges of communication, Everett learned a lot about the Pirahã. The Pirahã language and culture focus on the here-and-now. All in all, they appear to outsiders to be content (满足), generally good-natured with one another, and disinterested in any culture, language, or technology other than their own.
