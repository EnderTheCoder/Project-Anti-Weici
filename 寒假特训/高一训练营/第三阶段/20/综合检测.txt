题目:        How often do you eat dairy products like milk and butter? Probably, pretty often! You may or may not know that both of those foods come from cows. Interesting, right? But it had us wondering about a few things: What's the milking process like? How are dairy cows cared for? What kind of knowledge or skill do you need to be a dairy farmer? Well, that's where Bruce, Owner of Kriemhild Dairy Farms, comes in. Read on to learn more about Bruce's awesome job!        A typical day for dairy farmers starts with waking up before dawn to round up the cows for milking. Between 3:30 and 4:30 a.m., the cows are gathered from their paddocks (围场), then Bruce and his staff start milking at 5 a.m.. But, before milking, their teats (乳头) and the milking rooms must be properly cleaned. The milkers are then placed on teats, then removed once finished and disinfected (消毒) once more.They milk at 5 a.m. and 3 p.m., so everything they do in the morning, they do again in the afternoon.        So what happens to all of this milk after it's obtained from the cows? Well, it goes through a filter (过滤器), then through a chiller, which uses cold water to lower the milk temperature. Once it passes through this stage, the milk is released into a bulk tank, which is where large quantities of milk are stored to improve milk quality by cooling it faster. The milk is then picked up every second day and some is taken to the Kriemhild Dairy Plant to be turned into butter. The staff separate the fat from the milk, which will end up with cream and skim milk. Bruce has to work hard to balance all of his responsibilities running the farm.        Managing the farm is important but for Bruce, the best part of his job is taking care of his cows. He makes sure to monitor all of the health and hygiene (卫生) of cows. If the cows look sick at all, they have to treat them or have the vet check them. And, to ensure all cows are treated well, their staff goes through training before taking on their roles to make sure the cows are always at ease.        If being a dairy farmer sounds like a great career to you, we know how you can begin! It's important to consider that farmers need to know quite a bit about many different things like managing money, talking to people and so on. Try and get an internship (实习工作) on a farm, work on a farm and you can do it.
