题目:        The winter holiday is over. It is time to think of the new school term. And while some are eager to meet their friends to tell them about all their winter adventures, others are more worried about the new term. Here are some tips for a smooth school term start that will help you beat the stress and organize your study environment.Reconnecting with a healthy lifestyle        During holidays, you often sleep late and eat a little of what you wanted at any time. The first thing to do is to help yourself make a smooth start and not to wait until the last day to find a healthy lifestyle. You should get used to having regular and reasonable hours of sleep and to eating healthy food. This of course needs several days of “rehabilitation” (恢复). The ideal thing is to start reconnecting with a healthy lifestyle one week before school starts.Developing dialogue        If you feel anxious of the new term, it is very important to talk to your parents about your fears. They will surely find a way to help you get over your fears and gain confidence. They will certainly show you that they believe in your abilities, and will be willing to help you. It is also important that you develop self confidence and believe in your own potential.Beat stress        If you are overly anxious about performance, work through your negative (负面的) beliefs, especially the beliefs about the effect of school failure. Challenge your negative thoughts that your worth as a person depends entirely on your grades. Good performance will be achieved only when you beat your fears and discover your own personal worth.Set goals        Enjoy setting goals for yourself, so you can overcome your weaknesses and reach your full potential. Your study goals must be realistic and achievable. For example, start with small steps to reach higher targets.
