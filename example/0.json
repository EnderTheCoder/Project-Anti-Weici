    "subject": "        Chess is called the game of kings. It has been around for a long time. People have been playing it for over 500 years. Chess is based on an even older game from India. The chess we play today is from Europe.        Chess is a two-player game. One player uses the white pieces. The other uses black pieces. Each piece moves in a special way. One piece is called the king. Each player has one. The players take turns moving their pieces. If a player lands on a piece, he or she takes it. The game ends when a player loses his or her king. There are a few more rules, but those are the basics.        Some people think that chess is more than a game. They think that it makes the mind stronger. Good chess players use their brains. They take their time. They think about what will happen next. These skills are useful in life and in chess. Chess is kind of like a work out for the mind.        You don't always have lots of time to think when playing chess. There is a type of chess with short time limits. It's called blitz chess (象棋闪电战). In blitz chess, each player gets ten minutes to use for the whole game. Your clock runs during your turn. You hit the time clock after your move. This stops your clock. It also starts the other player's clock. If you run out of time, you lose. Games of blitz chess are fast-paced.        Chess is not just for people. Computers have been playing chess since the 1970s. At first they did not play well. They made mistakes. As time went on they grew stronger. In 1997, a computer beat the best player in the world for the first time. It was a computer called Deep Blue. Deep Blue was big. It took up a whole room. By 2006 a cell phone could beat the best players in the world. Chess sure has come a long way. Don't you think so?",

    "subject": "        The winter holiday is over. It is time to think of the new school term. And while some are eager to meet their friends to tell them about all their winter adventures, others are more worried about the new term. Here are some tips for a smooth school term start that will help you beat the stress and organize your study environment.Reconnecting with a healthy lifestyle        During holidays, you often sleep late and eat a little of what you wanted at any time. The first thing to do is to help yourself make a smooth start and not to wait until the last day to find a healthy lifestyle. You should get used to having regular and reasonable hours of sleep and to eating healthy food. This of course needs several days of “rehabilitation” (恢复). The ideal thing is to start reconnecting with a healthy lifestyle one week before school starts.Developing dialogue        If you feel anxious of the new term, it is very important to talk to your parents about your fears. They will surely find a way to help you get over your fears and gain confidence. They will certainly show you that they believe in your abilities, and will be willing to help you. It is also important that you develop self confidence and believe in your own potential.Beat stress        If you are overly anxious about performance, work through your negative (负面的) beliefs, especially the beliefs about the effect of school failure. Challenge your negative thoughts that your worth as a person depends entirely on your grades. Good performance will be achieved only when you beat your fears and discover your own personal worth.Set goals        Enjoy setting goals for yourself, so you can overcome your weaknesses and reach your full potential. Your study goals must be realistic and achievable. For example, start with small steps to reach higher targets.",
