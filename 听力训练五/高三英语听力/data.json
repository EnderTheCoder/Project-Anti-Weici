We have to use several ferries, each one carrying four people. But we’ve been very lucky to secure a sailing boat which is big enough for all of us. I’m really excited about this part of the trip, because we’ll see the islands to the best advantage, and we’ll be able to sail around and sleep on board. We’ll get off at different islands and for one part of the trip we’ll have people playing Greek traditional music actually on board with us.&nbsp;</p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":11685,\"main_id\":61867,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What does the speaker think the trip to the Greek Islands will be?\\t\\t\\t\\t\",\"answer\":\"C.

We’ll leave London Gatwick Airport on British Airways next Wednesday. Please be sure to be at the airport by 6:30. I know it’s early, but our departure time is 8:30 a.m. We’re quite a large group, and we don’t want to have any troubles. Please be sure to have all your travel documents ready. We’ll arrive in Athens at 2:00 in the afternoon, and there’ll be a vehicle there to meet us. It’ll be a full-sized tourist bus so everyone can travel together. We’ll spend three full days in our hotel in Athens. The second day we’ll go to the National Museum to see the collection of ancient Greek works of art, antiques, statues — a brilliant show. Friday morning and afternoon we’ll visit historic sites. On Saturday we’re off to the Greek islands. Now, the big news! At first we thought we’d take the ferry.
