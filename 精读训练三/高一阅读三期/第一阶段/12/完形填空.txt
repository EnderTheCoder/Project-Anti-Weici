题目:        The telephone rang. It was my sister who worked in an elementary school. She told me that she used my ### again.
        Over forty years ago, I sat in my first-grade classroom ### the teacher asked me to go to the principal’s (校长) office. I was a shy kid and hated to be ### . 
        I pushed open the heavy oak door. Seated in front of the principal’s desk were my parents. My father walked straight over to me. ### my drawings, he asked, “Why do you only use a ### crayon when you draw?”
        I was too nervous to speak. 
        “ ### me your crayon box,” said my father.
        I ### my crayon box from the classroom and gave it to my father. He opened it and saw a single crayon lied in it — it was black. ### , my father asked, “Where are the rest of your crayons?”
        I ### explained that I’d given all the other crayons to friends. I’d been ### like my parents had taught me. My father let out a deep controlled ### , “You were sharing?”
        I nodded my head. I looked at my father, then at the principal — both their ### were red. The principal ### that I could go. I waved goodbye to my parents. My mother waved back, but I couldn’t get my father’s ### ; he was too busy glaring at the principal.
        I learned years later that my father’s face was red due to ### and the principal’s was red due to embarrassment. The principal, ### seeing all my artwork done in black crayon, assumed (认为) that I had deep emotional issues (心 理问题). He had called my parents in to ### “my problem”. Because I didn’t ### up for myself, others assumed the worst.
        Today my sister tells her students, “Don’t be ### to speak up. If you don’t — I just might make the ### assumption. And that’s not a good thing. Let me tell a story about my sister, when she was around your age …”
