       In the US, tornadoes (龙卷风) are responsible for many deaths and injuries each year. Although they occur quite frequently, tornadoes are difficult to predict. Why? Tornadoes develop from storms, but only some storms are likely to become tornadoes. Scientists don’t know where and when a storm will touch the ground and turn into a tornado. Today, the warning time for a tornado is usually just 13 minutes.        Tim Samaras is a storm chaser (追逐者). His job is to find tornadoes and follow them. When he gets close to a tornado, he puts a special tool called a turtle probe on the ground. This tool measures things like a tornado’s temperature, humidity (湿度), and wind speed. With this information, Samaras can learn what causes tornadoes to develop. If meteorologists (气象学家) understand this, they can warn people about tornadoes sooner and save lives.        How does Samaras hunt tornadoes? It’s not easy. First, he has to find one. Tornadoes are too small to see using weather satellites. So Samaras can’t rely on these tools to find a tornado. Instead he waits for tornadoes to develop.Every May and June, Samaras drives about 40,000 kilometers across an area known as Tornado Alley, looking and hoping to spot a tornado.        Once Samaras sees a tornado, the chase begins. But a tornado is hard to follow. Some tornadoes change direction several times — for example, moving east and then west and then east again. When Samaras finally gets near a tornado, he puts the turtle probe on the ground. Being this close to a tornado is terrifying. Debris (碎片) is flying in the air. Then wind is blowing at high speed.

Perhaps you need a birthday present for someone who is hard to please. How about clothing? You might be worried about choosing the wrong size, color, or style. Books or DVDs? You may not know enough about the person’s likes, dislikes, and interests. And giving money may not seem right. Well, how about a gift card?        A gift card is a card that is issued (发行) by a certain store. It’s worth a certain amount of money. It looks like a credit card (信用卡), but it actually works like cash. A gift-card holder can spend the amount of money noted on the card in the store that issued it. These cards are big money makers. One reason is that when gift-card holders go to the store, they often see other things to buy, and they end up spending more money than the gift card is worth. Unused cards are another big source of revenue (收益).         Gift cards are becoming extremely popular in many countries around the world. Why? People love the convenience — cards are easy to buy and easy to use, either in the store or online. The receiver can select his or her own gift, and the giver doesn’t have to worry about finding just the right thing.        Receiving a gift card, however, is not the same as receiving a gift. An actual gift is a better reminder of the person who gave it. It helps us appreciate the thought and effort that went into the choice. The message of a real gift is more likely to be, “I spent some time trying to find the right gift for you because I care about you.”        Often a gift card doesn't pass on the same message as an actual gift. It may seem to say, “I was in a hurry. I didn't have time to think about what you really like.” In today's busy world, gift cards are certainly convenient.

In our latest study we examined if not only the total amount of sitting, but different types of sitting, were connected with developing type 2 diabetes. We wanted to see if there was any difference among sitting watching TV, sitting at work, or sitting at home but not watching TV.         We studied sitting habits of 4,811 middle-aged people, who didn’t have diabetes or heart problems at the start of the study. Over the next 13 years, 402 people developed diabetes.
