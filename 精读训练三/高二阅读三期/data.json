       Nyota had just arrived at the school's track and put on her volunteer name tag (标签) when her best friend, Lily, approached. “I'm sorry that you can't participate in the track meet today,” said Lily.    “I am, too,” Nyota replied, gazing (盯着) at the track in front of her. Nyota had fallen and hurt her wrist the previous week while training for the long jump, so she was volunteering to sell soft drinks instead of competing along with her teammates.        Nyota wished Lily good luck and watched her friend walked quickly to the track as the audience started to arrive. Nyota knew she should head over to the concession stand (营业摊点), but she kept staring at the place where she had fallen. “What's the point of being here?” Nyota thought to herself.        Just then, she heard a friendly voice behind her say, “Hello, Nyota! Can you help me find a seat?” It was Mrs Ogaz, Lily's grandmother, whom Nyota knew well. “I want to sit up high so I can see, but I need help going up the stairs.”      “I would love to help you, Mrs Ogaz,” replied Nyota.        Mrs Ogaz leaned on Nyota's good arm as they carefully climbed up the bleachers (露天看台) to a spot with a great view of the finish line. “Thank you so much! You're very helpful.” Mrs Ogaz's comment lifted Nyota's spirits.        Nyota hurried over to the concession stand and started selling soft drinks. Before she knew it, the track meet was over. After the last winner had accepted his ribbon, the head teacher made an announcement to thank all of the student volunteers who had helped out at the meet.

The man was E·B·White. E·B·— or Andy, as he was called — thought spiders were wonderful creatures. He thought that one day he might like to write a children's book about a spider.        But writing was hard work for Andy. He had written many articles and essays and poems. He had also written one children's book, Stuart Little. But Andy could never just rush to turn an idea into an article or a book. He told his editor that he needed to let his ideas “ripen”.        So for years, Andy continued to think about writing a children's book about a spider. He did some of his best thinking while he wandered around his farm.        Once while he was cleaning his barn, he found a spider's egg sac (卵囊). Andy wanted to see the eggs hatch (孵化). But he was scheduled to leave for a trip to New York City. So he found a small box and carefully placed the egg sac inside. When he got to his hotel, he put the box on the dresser. One morning he woke up, and there were hundreds of baby spiders rushing across the dresser!        Years later, Andy finally began writing Charlotte's Web, the story of a spider named Charlotte and a pig named Wilbur. Andy created most of the book sitting by himself in the tiny boathouse of his farm.        Sometimes he stopped writing and aimlessly drew pictures of spiders. Andy always said Charlotte's Web was more than just a children's story about animals. It was a timeless story about true friendship.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"to let his ideas “ripen”","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"第10周星期五","sub":"[{\"id\":6108,\"main_id\":51075,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What is the main idea of this text?\",\"answer\":\"D.

He thought that one day he might like to write a children&#39;s book about a spider.<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But writing was hard work for Andy. He had written many articles and essays and poems. He had also written one children&#39;s book, Stuart Little. But Andy could never just rush to turn an idea into an article or a book. He told his editor that he needed to let his ideas “ripen”.<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So for years, Andy continued to think about writing a children&#39;s book about a spider. He did some of his best thinking while he wandered around his farm.<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once while he was cleaning his barn, he found a spider&#39;s egg sac (卵囊). Andy wanted to see the eggs hatch (孵化). But he was scheduled to leave for a trip to New York City. So he found a small box and carefully placed the egg sac inside. When he got to his hotel, he put the box on the dresser. One morning he woke up, and there were hundreds of baby spiders rushing across the dresser!<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Years later, Andy finally began writing Charlotte&#39;s Web, the story of a spider named Charlotte and a pig named Wilbur. Andy created most of the book sitting by himself in the tiny boathouse of his farm.<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes he stopped writing and aimlessly drew pictures of spiders. Andy always said Charlotte&#39;s Web was more than just a children&#39;s story about animals.

A lot! On a clear night you might see the Moon, some planets, and thousands of stars.        But scientists believe there are some things in the sky that we will never see. We won't see them with the biggest telescope in the world, on the clearest night of the year. That's because they are invisible. They're the mysterious dead stars called black holes.        You might find it hard to imagine that stars die. After all, our Sun is a star. Year after year we see it up in the sky, burning brightly, giving us heat and light. The Sun certainly doesn't seem to be getting old or weak. But stars do burn out and die after billions of years.        As a star's gases burn, they give off light and heat. But when the gases run out, the star stops burning and begins to die.    As the star cools, the outer layers of the star pull in toward the center. The star squashes into a smaller and smaller ball. If the star was very small, the star ends up as a cold, dark ball. If the star was very big, it keeps squashing inward until it's packed together tighter than anything in the universe.        Imagine if the Earth were crushed (挤压) until it was the size of a tiny marble. That's how tightly this dead star, a black hole, is packed. What pulls the star in toward its center with such power? It's the same force that pulls you down when you jump — the force called gravity. A black hole is so tightly packed that its gravity sucks (吸) in everything — even light.

Once they were in the United States, they rapidly took over. By 1990, they had spread throughout the Great Lakes, and by 2008, they were in bodies of water in at least 24 of the 50 states. In only 20 years, these tiny creatures had made their way halfway across the country.        Zebra mussels have caused a lot of damage in every ecosystem they live in. They take over the habitats of native mollusks and fish and eat their food. They affect humans by attaching themselves to boats and structures in the water. Zebra mussels can destroy wood, concrete, and even steel. They sink buoys (航标) and slow down ships by attaching to them in enormous numbers. They are numerous (许多的) enough to block water pipes leading to and from power and water plants. Zebra mussels also pollute beaches, and their sharp shells (壳) are a danger to swimmers.        There is no single effective way to deal with zebra mussels. They can be removed with scrapers, hot water, and air pressure. They can also be prevented from attaching by using chemicals, barriers, and coatings.

In 1988, however, zebra mussels were sighted far from home. They had suddenly appeared in the United States. It is believed that they were brought over on a ship from the Black Sea. Once they were in the United States, they rapidly took over. By 1990, they had spread throughout the Great Lakes, and by 2008, they were in bodies of water in at least 24 of the 50 states. In only 20 years, these tiny creatures had made their way halfway across the country.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Zebra mussels have caused a lot of damage in every ecosystem they live in. They take over the habitats of native mollusks and fish and eat their food. They affect humans by attaching themselves to boats and structures in the water. Zebra mussels can destroy wood, concrete, and even steel. They sink buoys (航标) and slow down ships by attaching to them in enormous numbers. They are numerous (许多的) enough to block water pipes leading to and from power and water plants. Zebra mussels also pollute beaches, and their sharp shells (壳) are a danger to swimmers.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no single effective way to deal with zebra mussels. They can be removed with scrapers, hot water, and air pressure. They can also be prevented from attaching by using chemicals, barriers, and coatings. Power stations and water treatment plants spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to deal with them, but the zebra mussels can always return. Unfortunately, zebra mussels are here to stay.
