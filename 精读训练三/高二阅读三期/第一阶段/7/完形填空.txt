题目:        I was a single mother of four children, working at a little-waged job. Money was always ###, but we had a roof over our heads, food on the table, and ### on our backs. It was Christmas time. We ### downtown to see the Christmas lights, and enjoyed a special dinner, ### the big excitement for the kids was the fun of Christmas ### at the mall. They talked and planned for weeks ahead of time, ### each other what they wanted for Christmas.
        The big day arrived and we started out early. I ### each of the four kids a twenty-dollar bill and asked them to ### for gifts. Then everyone scattered (分散).
        Back in the car driving home, everyone was ### about Christmas, laughing and asking each other about what they had ###. I noted Ginger, my younger daughter, had only one small and flat bag with her. I could ### enough through the plastic ### to tell that she had bought candy bars — fifty-cents candy bars! What did she ### with that twenty-dollar bill I had given her? I was so ###. After getting home, I called her into my bedroom and closed the door. This was what she told me:
      “I was looking around, ### of what to buy, and I ### to read the little cards on one of the Salvation Army’s‘Giving Trees’. One of the cards was ### a little girl, four years old, and all she ### for Christmas was a doll with clothes and a hairbrush. So I took the card off the ### and bought the doll and the hairbrush for her.”
        My anger ### and I had never felt so rich as I did that day.
