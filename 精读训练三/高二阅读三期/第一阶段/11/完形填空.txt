题目:        I was in Houston a few weeks ago, and needed to be back home in Austin by the early morning the next day. So I ### to leave that evening. ###, my tire blew out on the way. I ### a small parking lot. Then I ### the doors and picked up my phone to call a tow truck (拖车). Soon a man ### on my driver’s side window and asked if he could help me. From his ### and behavior, I knew he was far more ### to rob (抢劫) than help me, so I ### refused and told him the tow truck was due any minute. He asked again, but again I gently shook my head. He finally said, “Ma’am, you need ###. A tow truck in Houston will arrive anywhere between 45 minutes and approximately ### (which I knew was true), and you aren’t going anywhere until you have that tire ###.”
        I looked hard, straight into his ###, and instinctively (凭直觉) saw someone different from the ### person he appeared to be at first glance. So, against all reasonable ###, but trusting my instincts, I got out. He looked ###, but got right to work, trying to find the ### tire. It took a while since it was stored under the van (车厢).
        He changed the tire, ### the seat to its place and said, “Thank you for letting me help you. You gave me a ### when most people would never open the door to someone like me. Would it be okay if I gave you a hug?” When I ###, I gave him a giant hug. I left with a new tire and a renewed ### in human nature.
