So I took the bus to Boston and got there the day before the ### .

To avoid being arrested or pulled off the course, I had a blue hooded (带风帽的) sweatshirt pulled up over my ### with my hair tied back. Then, there was the bang, but I waited until about half the pack left —then I ### in.
        Even though I was disguised (伪装), the other runners ### very quickly that I was a woman. Fortunately, they were very ### . I told them that I was ### I would be thrown out if officials saw that I was a woman. But they said, “We won't let that ### . It's a free road.” That's when I ### the hooded sweatshirt and everyone could see I was a woman. Then people went ### . They started shouting and clapping, “Way to go, girlie!”
        Finally I ran into Boston and ### the race in 3 hours and 21 minutes. 
        I went back to Boston and ran ### in 1967 and 1968. I hope to be a(n) ### of someone who follows what they ### and what they're good at. I think everyone came to this world to ### something.
