题目:        Mom had lived in a nursing home for the past three and a half years, suffering the increasing effects of dementia (痴呆症). They were tough years, actually ### for us family members than for her, I believe. She suffered very little ### in those final years, less than she ### when living in her own home. This was because other people took better care of her than she did herself.
        All dementia is not alike. Mom’s form ### her short-term memory more than her long-term memory. By the time she went to the nursing home, her short-term memory was ### non-existent. We learned to ### our conversations with her to old things of the past. Usually, she could connect with these ### and seem to enjoy us ### about them. I noticed in her last year that her long-term memory was ###, too. And it became ever more ### to attract her. In her last six months, we had very little ### of her responding, though a few times she ### us. So, when we called her, we would just ### to tell her about our lives, things we were doing, things our children and grandchildren were doing. The ### would be short. We would tell her we loved her; she would either be ### or make some grunting (咕哝) sounds.
        ### I expected Mom’s death, it was still bad news to hear. She is ###. Even one-way conversations were more ### than no conversations.
        So now, all we have are ### and a few physical items that were hers or gifts from her. On Mother’s Day this year we will send no ###, no gift, make no call. But we will remember her.
