Maybe that is why there are so many expressions that use the word cold. For centuries, the body’s blood has been linked closely with the emotions. People who show no human emotions or feelings, for example, are said to be cold-blooded. Cold-blooded people act in merciless ways. They may do brutal things to others, and not by accident. For example, a newspaper says the police are searching for a cold\u0002blooded killer. The killer murdered someone, not in self-defense. He seemed to kill with no emotion.        Cold can affect other parts of the body, the feet, for example. Heavy socks can warm your feet, if your feet are really cold. But there is an expression — to get cold feet — that has nothing to do with cold or your feet. The expression means being afraid to do something you had decided to do. For example, you agree to be president of an organization. But then you learn that all the other officers have resigned. All the work of the organization will be your responsibility. You are likely to get cold feet about being president when you understand the situation.        Cold can also affect your shoulder. You give someone the cold shoulder when you refuse to speak to them. You treat them in a distant, cold way. The expression probably comes from the physical act of turning your back toward someone, instead of speaking to him face-to-face. You may give a cold shoulder to a friend who has not kept a promise he made to you. Or, to someone who has lied about you to others.        A cold fish is not a fish. It is a person. But it is a person who is unfriendly, unemotional and shows no love or warmth. A cold fish does not offer much of himself to anyone.        Out in the cold is an expression often heard.

However, they might be taking that goal too seriously. Studies have found that children typically forget between one and three months’ worth of school learning during the summer months. Spelling and math abilities suffer the most, while reading is not really influenced by the time off. The most probable reason for this is that most children read at least occasionally outside of the classroom, whether newspapers, magazines, books, or video game guides. However, their math and spelling skills only get exercised in the school setting.        The original purpose of summer vacations was to let farm children have time off to help work in the fields in the high growing season, but this reason is no longer valid since fewer kids actually work on farms today. Some cities in the United States, such as Los Angeles, have moved to a year-round school calendar, which may help reduce the academic decline that occurs during the long summer vacation. Most cities maintain the normal nine and a half-month calendars. To improve skills and to maintain a good level of preparation, educators recommend trips to museums, summer camps, vacations with educational components, and visits to libraries to keep kids mentally alert (机敏的) and interested throughout the summer.        There are other educational systems that provide vacations while still keeping students’ skills sharp. For example, in Japan students attend class for seven weeks continuously, followed by two weeks of vacation. This continues throughout the year. In Italy, students attend class six days per week, but finish at 1:30 pm each day, so that school does not dominate (主 宰) their life the way that it does in America, where students attend high school from 7:45 am until 3:00 pm each week day.         School administrators and educational specialists fear that the three-month summer vacation stops the continuity of learning. Just as students become accustomed to new math equations or new concepts in reading, writing, or critical thinking skills, they “shut down” for an extended period. When they go back to school after the long summer vacation, they take up to two months to return to their previous level of proficiency (熟练).

And that early anxiety about dealing with numbers can put a child at a significant disadvantage, not only in school but in negotiating life and a career. Fortunately, a study of third-graders, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, suggests an intervention (干预) that can help. One-on-one tutoring does more than teach kids. It can help reduce the fear of math anxiety.      “The most exciting aspect of our findings is that cognitive (认知的) tutoring not only improves performance, but is also anxiety-reducing,” says Vinod Menon.        Menon and his colleagues knew from their earlier research using MRI scans (核磁扫描) of the brain that math anxiety activates much the same network of cells that some other common fears activate — fear of snakes or spiders or heights, for example. And they knew that a behavioral treatment known as exposure therapy helps some people solve the anxiety of those other phobias. Could the same thing be happening with math tutoring?        To find out, the scientists invited 46 third-graders who answered questions about math worries and were also tested on simple addition problems while having their brains scanned via functional MRI. Based on their answers, scans and scores in each of the tests, the children were divided into two groups: one considered to have higher levels of math anxiety and one with lower levels. Afterward, both groups received eight weeks of one-on-one tutoring in basic arithmetic (算术), a few sessions a week.        Both groups did better in math at the end of the tutoring, Menon says. But most importantly, he says, the kids who had been anxious about math were 20 percent less anxious at the end of the eight weeks — a finding their brain scans confirmed.        The tutoring was highly personalized — if a child got stuck on a particular concept, the tutor would work with the student to “get beyond the bottleneck in a non-negative, encouraging way”.        Menon hopes to next study whether computerized tutoring can produce similar benefits and whether the reduction in math anxiety continues to exist as the children advance to more complex problem-solving skills.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p>本文是一篇说明文。研究表明，“数学恐惧症”不仅影响孩子的在校表现，还影响孩子将来平衡生活和工作的能力。而一对一辅导有助于减轻“数学恐惧症”。那电脑辅导会不会有同样的作用呢？</p>","source":"高考模拟试题二阅读理解C篇","sub":"[{\"id\":8765,\"main_id\":55806,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"According to the text, early math anxiety may affect children’s ###.\",\"answer\":\"B. ability to harmonize life and work\",\"answer_a\":\"A. intelligence quality \",\"answer_b\":\"B. ability to harmonize life and work\",\"answer_c\":\"C. life skills\",\"answer_d\":\"D. career choices\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p>事实细节题 根据第一段Math can be as scary as spiders and snakes, at least in the brain of an 8-year-old child.

Activities like playing computer games, going on the Net and downloading MP3s are only for the youngsters. Isn’t it unfair that older people enjoying a computer game should be frowned (皱眉) upon by their children and grandchildren?         Nowadays older people have more control over their lives and they play a full part in society. Moreover, better health care has left more people in their sixties and seventies feeling fit and active after retirement. Mental activity, as well as physical exercise, can contribute to better health. Playing computer games is a very effective way of exercising the brain.        When personal computers were first introduced, most older people didn’t believe they would ever familiarize themselves with it. Now computers have been around for a few generations and retired people have gradually become more relaxed about using them for fun. Gamers over 65 prefer playing puzzle games and card games. Kate Stevens, aged 72, says: “I find it very relaxing. It’s not very demanding, but you still need to concentrate.”        Another development that has favoured “grey games” is a change in the type of videogames available on the market. There’s a greater variety of games to choose from, including more intellectual and complex strategy (策略) and simulation (模拟) games. Internet Chess and Train Simulator are among the most popular of these. Train Simulator is based on real-world rail activities. Players can choose from a variety of challenges, such as keeping to a strict-timetable and using helper engines during a winter storm.         Some people argue that “grey gamers” simply don’t have the skills required for computer games, and that teenagers are better. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Most computer games require the kind of analytical thinking that improves with practice, which means that the “grey gamers” may well be far better than gamers half a century younger than them. In games where speed is the main consideration, older people would be at a disadvantage because they may have slower reaction times. On the other hand, “grey gamers” have a preference for slower paced, mind challenging games.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p>本文是一篇议论文，提出了老年人也可以玩电脑游戏这一观点。</p>","source":"阅读理解D","sub":"[{\"id\":8772,\"main_id\":55812,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"The second paragraph is intended to ______.\",\"answer\":\"C. explain why grey gamers exist \",\"answer_a\":\"A. show the best way to exercise the brain \",\"answer_b\":\"B. stress the importance of good health\",\"answer_c\":\"C. explain why grey gamers exist \",\"answer_d\":\"D. teach how to play videogames\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p>写作目的题 第二段介绍了随着人类寿命的延长，老年人更长寿，身体也更加健康、有活力，希望参与更多的活动，这为老年人涉足电脑游戏领域提供了可能。而且，电脑游戏能促进大脑运动，对老人健康有益，这就促使了一批老年游戏玩家的产生。</p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":8773,\"main_id\":55812,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What was older people’s attitude towards personal computers at first?\",\"answer\":\"A.

Through the apartment walls he could hear the crying of the neighbor’s newborn child competing with the music from the cars below. Dwayne sat and stared at the blank paper in front of him, considering how he would write a composition about his life.        Mama wouldn’t be home for another half an hour, so Dwayne went to the kitchen to prepare dinner for his family. With Mama’s meager salary, there wasn’t much to choose from.        “I’m hungry,” said eight-year-old Raymond. “What do you have cookin’?”        Holding his brother around the waist, Dwayne responded, “I’ve got my famous bean and rice casserole (砂锅菜). Want to help?”        “I want to help, too!” cried Jesse.        Shortly after 7:00 pm, Mama got home. She saw her three sons laughing as they worked together setting the mismatched plates and forks.

Dwayne’s mother looked around at the house.
