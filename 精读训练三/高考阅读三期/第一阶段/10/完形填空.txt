题目:        My parents operated a small restaurant in Seattle. It was open twenty-four hours a day, six days a week. And my first real job, when I was six years old, was ### the diners’ shoes. My father had done it when he was young, so he ### me how to do it efficiently, telling me to ### to re-shine the shoes if the diner wasn’t ###.
        Working in the restaurant was a cause of great ### because I was also working for the good of the family. But my father made it clear that I had to ### certain standards to be part of the team. I had to be punctual, hard-working, and polite to my ###.
        I was ### paid for the work I did at the restaurant. One day I made the ### of advising Dad that he should ### me $10 a week. He said, “OK. How about you paying me for three meals a day you have here? And for the times you bring in your friends for ### soft drinks?” He ### I owed him about $40 a week.
        I remember returning to Seattle after being ### in the US Army for about two years. I had just been promoted to Captain at that time. And full of pride, I walked into my parents’ restaurant, but the ### thing Dad said was, “How about doing the ### tonight?” I couldn’t ### my ears! I am an officer in the Army! But it didn’t ### . As far as Dad was concerned, I was just some ### of the team. I reached for the mop (拖把). Working for Dad has taught me the ### to a team is above all. It has nothing to do with whether that team is ### in a family restaurant or the US Army.
