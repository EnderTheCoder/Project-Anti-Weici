题目:       Dwayne sat staring at the peeling (剥落了的) paint on the walls of the small, messy room he shared with his two younger brothers. Through the apartment walls he could hear the crying of the neighbor’s newborn child competing with the music from the cars below. Dwayne sat and stared at the blank paper in front of him, considering how he would write a composition about his life.        Mama wouldn’t be home for another half an hour, so Dwayne went to the kitchen to prepare dinner for his family. With Mama’s meager salary, there wasn’t much to choose from.        “I’m hungry,” said eight-year-old Raymond. “What do you have cookin’?”        Holding his brother around the waist, Dwayne responded, “I’ve got my famous bean and rice casserole (砂锅菜). Want to help?”        “I want to help, too!” cried Jesse.        Shortly after 7:00 pm, Mama got home. She saw her three sons laughing as they worked together setting the mismatched plates and forks. In the middle of the table she eyed an old baby food jar with a flowering weed that was pulled from the front yard.       “Mmmm-mmmmmm! Is that your famous bean and rice casserole?” Mama asked.       “Mama, you’re home!” the two younger boys said as they raced to hug her.       After the dinner, Mama stood behind Dwayne as he sat at the kitchen table, adding the last sentence to his composition. “Son, what are you writing?”       “Mama, it’s my composition,” came his reply.       “And what is that composition about?”       “It’s about our life,” said Dwayne.       Dwayne’s mother looked around at the house. She thought about all the things she wished she could provide for her family.       “Dwayne, I’m sorry you don’t have a lot in your life,” his mama said.        “I have you and Raymond and Jesse. I live in a house full of love. I wouldn’t trade what we have for all the money in the world.”       Pulling her son close she whispered, “Neither would I, Dwayne. Neither would I.”
