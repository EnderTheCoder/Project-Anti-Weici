题目:        As summer comes near, many children are really happy to forget about school for a few months. However, they might be taking that goal too seriously. Studies have found that children typically forget between one and three months’ worth of school learning during the summer months. Spelling and math abilities suffer the most, while reading is not really influenced by the time off. The most probable reason for this is that most children read at least occasionally outside of the classroom, whether newspapers, magazines, books, or video game guides. However, their math and spelling skills only get exercised in the school setting.        The original purpose of summer vacations was to let farm children have time off to help work in the fields in the high growing season, but this reason is no longer valid since fewer kids actually work on farms today. Some cities in the United States, such as Los Angeles, have moved to a year-round school calendar, which may help reduce the academic decline that occurs during the long summer vacation. Most cities maintain the normal nine and a half-month calendars. To improve skills and to maintain a good level of preparation, educators recommend trips to museums, summer camps, vacations with educational components, and visits to libraries to keep kids mentally alert (机敏的) and interested throughout the summer.        There are other educational systems that provide vacations while still keeping students’ skills sharp. For example, in Japan students attend class for seven weeks continuously, followed by two weeks of vacation. This continues throughout the year. In Italy, students attend class six days per week, but finish at 1:30 pm each day, so that school does not dominate (主 宰) their life the way that it does in America, where students attend high school from 7:45 am until 3:00 pm each week day.         School administrators and educational specialists fear that the three-month summer vacation stops the continuity of learning. Just as students become accustomed to new math equations or new concepts in reading, writing, or critical thinking skills, they “shut down” for an extended period. When they go back to school after the long summer vacation, they take up to two months to return to their previous level of proficiency (熟练). And so the debate continues: whether to continue the present situation in terms of vacations or to seek changes based on the Los Angeles or the Japanese models.
