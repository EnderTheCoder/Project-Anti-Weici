题目:       “Welcome, Mary,” I said. She raised her head and looked into my eyes. The smile on my face ###. Dear God, I thought, what ### has entered the life of this little girl?
       After settling Mary into her new desk and ### her, I went to the headmaster. She said, “Sit down and you’ll be ### . Mary’s mother who loved her very much was shot and killed in her ### one night at their house. Mary, ###, escaped to a neighbor’s. She hadn’t cried or ### her mother since.”

       In spite of our ### , we seemed to be getting no closer to Mary and even my ### was wearing thin. My heart ached so badly, and I wanted this child to come alive, to be aware of the beauty, the wonder, the fun, and even the ### of living.
