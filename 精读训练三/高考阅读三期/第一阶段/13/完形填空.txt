题目:        Last week I was invited to a doctor’s meeting at the Ruth hospital for incurables. In one of the wards (病房) a patient, an old man, got up shakily from his bed and moved towards me. I could see that he hadn’t long to ###, but he came up to me and placed his right foot close mine on the floor. “Frank!” I cried in astonishment. He couldn’t ###, as I knew, but all the time ### his foot against mine. 
        My ### raced back many years to the ### days of 1941, when I was a student in London. The ### was an air-raid shelter, in which about hundred other people and I slept every night. Two of the regulars were Mrs West and 
her son Frank. ### wartime problems, we shelter-dwellers (居民) got to ### each other very well. Frank West ### me because he wasn’t ### , not even at birth. His mother told me he was 37 then, but he had ### of a mind than a baby has. His “ ### ” consisted of rough sounds — sounds of pleasure or anger and no more. Mrs West, then about 75, was a strong, capable (有能力的) woman, ### she had to be, of course, because Frank ### on her entirely. He needed all the ### of a baby. One night a policeman came and told Mrs West that her house had been flattened by a 500-pounder. She ### nearly everything she owned. When that sort of thing happened, the rest of us helped the ### ones. So before we ### that morning, I stood beside Frank and ### my right foot against his. They were about the same size. That night, then, I took a pair of shoes to the shelter for Frank. But as soon as he saw me he came running and placed his right foot against mine. After that, his ### to me was always the same.
