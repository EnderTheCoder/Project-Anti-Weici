题目:        The phone call came one cool winter day. I was ### that my father was seriously ill.
        It had been long since I saw my father. Ever since his ### from my mom, my father had lived alone in a small trailer (房车) in California, 500 miles away from me. The real ### between us seemed so much greater. I was in no hurry to ### that, but somehow I heard myself ### to the owner of the trailer to be there the next day.
        The whole drive down, ### flashed through my mind. I remembered my father, the proud Marine. He made sure the first song I ### was the Marine Hymn (《美国海军陆战队队歌》). He snatched off (扯下) the Christmas ### all the decorations and the rest of us had ### and rehung them so there was ### the same space between them. But we needn’t ### those military orders, as we were not soldiers. I remembered ### the battles he had with my mother. I remembered hoping to hear my father say ### once, “I love you, Patty,” only to have him ### at me, “You can’t do anything right!”
        And now here I was standing outside his trailer, trying to ### my courage to face him one more time. I knocked on the door, my hand and my whole body ### . No answer. Slowly I opened the door. I took a few ###inside and stopped, too shocked to believe my eyes.
        My father was sitting on his sofa, looking confused and crying. This wasn’t the ### man I had known growing up. He seemed broken.
        A sense of ### overtook me, and I knew what I had to do. He would be my father forever. Without ### , I went back inside and packed up all of my father’s things. I would take him to my home — our home.
