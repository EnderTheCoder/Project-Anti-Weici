题目:        As soon as the ball hit the bat, Esmeralda knew she would go for an extra base (垒). She thought she might even get to third. If she could round first without too wide an angle, and fly past second and third, she just might make it home.        “You should be playing softball,” the pitcher (投手) on the other team had told her before the game. “Baseball is for boys.”        “I want you home to help with housework,” her mother had told her that morning.        “But we need you, Esmeralda,” her coach, John Bunyan, had told her. “You’re the only hitter who can figure out Matt Thompson’s trick pitch.”        Matt Thompson was the pitcher on the Babson Babcocks. He threw a ball that nobody in the league could hit. And he was the same wise guy who had told her to stick to softball.        But Esmeralda was born to play baseball. “It’s in your genes (基因),” her grandpa, Papá Juan, told her. Papá Juan had played professional baseball in Cuba before. Now, he was sitting in the stands with all her family members.         That morning, Esmeralda had begged her mother for a chance to play in the game. “Mom, I feel lucky today. Plus, my team needs me.”        Now, Coach Bunyan was standing by the third base bag, waving Esmeralda on. She ran like a deer over the open field, tilting (倾斜) her shoulders at an angle. In her mind, she held a picture of the great player Ty Cobb, whom she had seen run like this in an old baseball book.        Coach Bunyan jumped up and down and waved his arms. “Run, Esmeralda! Run for home!”        A quick look to Matt Thompson, and Esmeralda saw that he was waving for the second baseman to throw the ball. The second baseman threw the ball high and to the first-base side of home plate. Esmeralda went into her slide, feet aimed at the catcher’s left knee, then at the last second she hooked to the right. She was safe!         Everyone in the stands was cheering wildly, including Papá Juan, her brother and sister, and her mom, María Elena. Esmeralda had hit a homer!
