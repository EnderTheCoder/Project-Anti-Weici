题目:        Our children grew up on jelly (果酱) sandwiches. Even my husband and I sometimes have one late at night with a glass of milk.
        I wasn’t the jelly maker in this ###. My mother-in-law was. The only contribution I made to the jelly making was to ### baby food jars, which my mother-in-law would ### with the tasty gel (凝胶) and send back home with us. For the past 22 years, ### I wanted to make a jelly sandwich, all I had to do was ### one of those little jars of jelly. Jelly making was just a way of life for my mother-in-law. She always followed the same ### — from picking the fruit to setting the ### jelly on the homemade shelves.
        My mother-in-law passed away last December. Among the things in the house to be ### by her children were the ### canned goods. Each of her children chose from the many jars of tomato juice, green beans and jelly. When my husband ### his jars home, we carefully put them away in our kitchen.
        The other day I reached the ### for some jelly, and there it was. Sitting all alone on the far side of the shelf was a small jar. The lid was rusty (生锈的). As I picked up the jar, I suddenly realized something that I had ### to see earlier. Yes, this was the ### jar we would ever have from the patient, ### hands of my mother-in-law. It seemed like such a ### thing, and most days it was something that was taken for granted (视为当然). But today it seemed a valuable ###. I put the jelly back on the shelf.
        We have many things that ### belonged to my mother-in-law. These are the kinds of things that we expect to pass on to our children. But I’m just not ### to give up this last jelly jar, and all the ### its presence allows me to hold onto. The jar of jelly won’t keep that ###. It will either have to be eaten or thrown out ... but not today.

答案:
