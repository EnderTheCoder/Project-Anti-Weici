题目:        British programmer Joshua Browder is helping people save much money on legal fees with his latest project — the world’s first robot lawyer. The 19-year-old first started the project last summer as a free website to help people appeal unfair parking tickets. He came up with the idea after getting a series of tickets himself for unimportant reasons. Having wasted hours on writing appeals to these tickets, he realized that many people have no time or legal knowledge to appeal. So he decided to create a robot lawyer, which he named DoNotPay.        DoNotPay was a success, and the tech genius has gone a step further with the website, converting (转变) it into a robot lawyer equipped to help with various legal issues. “The robot can handle parking ticket appeals and delayed flights / trains. It can also answer some general legal questions like ‘I can’t afford my ticket. What do I do?’” said Browder.        To use the service, users need to go to the website donotpay.co.uk and sign up for free. Once signed in, the robot will ask the user questions about their situation. When it has collected enough information, and if the person has legal grounds (依据) for an appeal, the robot will create a letter for the person to use.        Browder said he received good advice from his professors at Stanford University. “Initially, I thought the best way to go about it was to create many individual rules for it to follow,” he explained. “However, I quickly failed with this approach because there are thousands of ways to say the same thing and it would be impossible to catch every one. The breakthrough came when I learned how to create a way for the robot to learn and compare phrases itself, so that it doesn’t matter how the user phrases his or her requests.”        So he programmed the robot to use text comparison that includes keywords, word order and pronouns. And the more people use the robot, the better the algorithm (演算法) gets. But there’re situations where the robot can’t help. “If the robot can’t answer, it provides helpful message offering the user some sample phrases or the choice of contacting me directly,” Browder said. “On the backend, whenever the robot can’t answer, I get notified and I work as quickly as possible to add functionality for any future requests of a similar nature.”
