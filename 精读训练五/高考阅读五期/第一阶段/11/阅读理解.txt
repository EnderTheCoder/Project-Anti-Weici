题目:        The 64-year-old, a former senior officer at the State Bank of India, talks about his disabled and wounded dogs like a father about his children — with the same love, affection, and warmth.        He’s a well-known animal rights activist, the Secretary at People for Animals (PFA). But nothing defines (界定) Mahendra better than his love for animals. It was this love that led him to establish India’s first shelter home for dogs living with disabilities.        It all started in 1998 when, while taking a midnight walk, Mahendra came across a very weak dog on the street. Mahendra decided to feed it and for the next couple of days it became the centre of his life, until the night when he found it dead.        Since then, Mahendra started providing treatment to all wounded and sick dogs he came across. After some time, somebody told Mahendra about PFA, which is India’s largest animal welfare organization, chaired by Mrs. Maneka Gandhi. Mahendra contacted her and, impressed by the work he was doing, Mrs. Gandhi asked him to start a PFA chapter in Ahmedabad.        Thus, in 2014, he started the shelter. It took a long time for Mahendra to find land where the shelter could be set up. Finally, Ramesh Bhai Patel, a farmer from a village named Jundal, agreed to give his land for free. Along with a team of four doctors and many volunteers, the shelter now has twenty-five dogs that were unable to walk at all when they were brought in. Today, they’re slowly healing (康复).        Dogs that have healed with proper treatment are sent back to where they came from if the environment there is safe. However, the shelter will be home to the paralytic (瘫痪的) and blind dogs for all their lives, says Mahendra.        The shelter runs on the money coming from Mahendra’s own pocket. He and his wife get a monthly pension of 45,000 rupees (卢比) each. There have been some financial crunches now and then but Mahendra is determined that no matter what challenges come their way, they’ll fight through.
