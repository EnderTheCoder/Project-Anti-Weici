题目:        In June 2009, researchers in England released the results of experiments in which they had recorded the sounds made by young gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and human babies as they were being tickled (搔痒) on the feet. Scientists have traditionally been unwilling to identify the noises apes (猿) make as laughter, but research now suggests that they have been wrong. It turns out that apes do, in fact, laugh.        The analysis of the sounds from the laughter experiments showed that the ape noises were related to human laughter in the same way that ape genes are similar to human genes. In other words, ape laughter and human laughter developed in the same way many millions of years ago.        Although ape laughter and human laughter sound quite different, there are many similarities. The laughter of gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos sounds like fast breathing, or simply noisy breathing. Orangutan laughter is a series of quick snorts (哼声). Human laughter often sounds more pleasant than ape laughter, but humans have also been known to have laughter sounds that match the noises apes make.        The laughter of chimpanzees stood apart during the experiments because they laugh on both the inhale (吸入) and the exhale (呼出) of breath. Humans, gorillas, and bonobos, on the other hand, laugh only on the exhale. It takes longer than usual to exhale while laughing. Such laughter shows a type of breath control necessary for speech. Scientists used to believe that such breath control was unique to humans. These findings do not suggest that apes have the ability to speak, but they do support the idea that humans have more in common with apes than previously thought.
