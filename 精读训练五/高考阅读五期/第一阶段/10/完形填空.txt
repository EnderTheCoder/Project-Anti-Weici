题目:        I was a city girl who knew nothing about gardening. Then, in 2003, I ### gardening with 10 neighborhood children.
        At the time, I had a dress shop on the footpath between the church and their ###, and the children would ### for a drink of water. Sometimes, they were in the back of my ### doing homework. One day I gave them some fresh peas. I ### peas didn’t come from the grocery store basement, but some of the children did not. I just wanted to show them where ### came from.
        Our ### was considered a food desert: local people were ### to buy healthy food within walking distance, and ### people had cars. You could buy all the junk food you wanted, ### you couldn’t buy foods like an apple, orange or banana. So I started thinking, “This would be a lot ### if people could grow their own food.”
        Soon we started gardening with one bed, growing tomatoes and potatoes. The kids were so ###. It was like magic for them. And it was magic for me, ###.
        Now we have 65 beds. When people come to church for food ###, their eyes light up at the sight of fresh tomatoes, beans and potatoes. I ### them to become gardeners and offer them a bed of their own to ###.
        Now we have families growing their own vegetables, and community members ### affordable food at our marketplace. More than 1,800 people received fresh produce, and we ### over 4,000 pounds of surplus (剩余的) prepared foods. The ### of people coming to church for food assistance in the summer growing season has fallen.
        But the garden is about more than just food. Our community members ### in age from 3 to 93, and speak many different languages. We have a lot of divisions in our community, but in the garden everyone is the same.
