题目:        You will go to college some day and college is one of the most exciting stages of one’s life. If you wish to make the most of your campus (校园) experience and become a better person after those four years, then first you ought to make friends. Close friends contribute to your self growth for they provide you with moral support that is so important to surviving the stressful college life. Friends can lend a helping hand when necessary like collecting your homework when you’re too sick to leave your dorm, and help you develop the right attitude by pointing out to you your weaknesses.        Being home most of your life and then suddenly finding yourself on your own in a large campus without your parents to hold your hand can be annoying. However, rather than thinking about your missing home too much, why not see this new stage in your life as an opportunity for self growth and develop the right attitude that will prepare you for the rigors of post-graduation life, particularly when you join the workforce?        Special-interest clubs or organizations are great for self growth. Here, not only do you get the opportunity to meet with like-minded people, you can also discover more things about your field of interest. Club meetings usually include lively discussions, so go there with the right attitude. You should try to build a good name in the organization by being respectful, active and considerate to others.        You might not like all of your professors, but they are there to provide knowledge you need to be successful in your chosen field. Thus, show up for each class with the right attitude and determination to learn. 1 Whether you get along well with your professors or not has a huge effect on your self growth as it is a measure of how well you can respect authority and obey requirements.        Actively participating in a class debate or lecture contributes to your self growth as it helps you build confidence in speaking up and improves your communication skills. It also helps you develop the right attitude by exercising diplomacy (外交术) when you choose your words carefully especially when discussing a very politically sensitive issue (问题) and exercising patience when dealing with classmates who shoot down your ideas.
