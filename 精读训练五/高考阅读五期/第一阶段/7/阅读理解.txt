题目:        Lautaro had already spent hours viewing and reviewing the footage (影片片段) he had taken of his grandmother, Maida, in memory of her childhood in southern Italy. There was no shortage of material. Maida was fascinating as she talked about everything from picking grapes in her grandparents’ garden to avoiding wild dogs on her daily routine to school. The problem was finding the best form for the material.        Lautaro had already finished a rough cut that followed his grandmother’s story in time order. The video began with Maida’s earliest memories of the Italian farmyard and ended with her arrival in the United States at age 15, puzzled and excited. Lautaro used family photographs to illustrate (说明) Maida’s storytelling. He knew the first version was not bad, but he was not satisfied with the overall video. He was certain that something vital was missing.        Running out of his own ideas, Lautaro decided to get some advice. And who better to ask than Maida herself? Lautaro showed Maida the 10-minute video on his computer. As soon as it was over, Maida said, “I can’t get over how much things have changed, Taro. Your life seems so different from mine.” Maida’s words inspired Lautaro. Her reaction told him exactly what was missing: his personal point of view.        A few days later, when Lautaro screened his final project for his classmates and teacher, it was only two minutes longer than his original cut, but those extra minutes made a huge difference. Between Maida’s recollections of her past, Lautaro has added in photographs of his own life today. The contrasts were both striking and touching, and the final image of Lautaro listening to Maida reinforced (加强) the warmth comparative documentary with cheerful applause.
