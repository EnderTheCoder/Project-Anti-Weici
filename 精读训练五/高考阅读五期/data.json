{"data":[{"id":61245,"word_id":0,"test_group":3,"check_point":3,"questions":0,"subject":"Tayka Hotel de SalWhere: Tahua, BoliviaHow much: About $95 a nightWhy it’s cool: You’ve stayed at hotels made of brick or wood, but salt? That’s something few can claim. Tayka Hotel de Sal is made totally of salt — including the beds (though you’ll sleep on regular mattresses and blankets). The hotel sits on the Salar de Uyuni, a prehistoric dried-up lake which is the world’s biggest salt flat. Builders use the salt from the 4,633-square-mile flat to make the bricks, and glue them together with a paste (糊) of wet salt that hardens when it dries.Green Magic Nature ResortWhere: Vythiri, IndiaHow much: About $240 a nightWhy it’s cool: Taking a pulley-operated (靠滑轮操作的) lift 86 feet to your treetop room is just the start of your adventure. As you look out of your open window — there is no glass! — you watch monkeys and birds in the rain forest. Later you might test your fear of heights by crossing the handmade rope bridge to the main part of the hotel, or just sit on your bamboo bed and read. You don’t even have to come down for breakfast — the hotel will send it up on the pulley-drawn “elevator”.Dog Bark Park Inn B&BWhere: Cottonwood, IdahoHow much: $92 a nightWhy it’s cool: This doghouse isn’t just for the family pet. Sweet Willy is a 30-foot-tall dog with guest rooms in his belly. Climb the wooden stairs beside his hind leg to enter the door in his side. You can relax in the main bedroom, go up a few steps of the loft (阁楼) in Willy’s head, or hang out inside his nose. Although you have a full private bathroom in your quarters, there is also a toilet in the 12-foot-tall fire hydrant (消防栓) outside.Gamirasu Cave HotelWhere: Ayvali, TurkeyHow much: Between $130 and $475 a nightWhy it’s cool: This is caveman cool! Experience what it was like 5,000 years ago, when people lived in these mountain caves formed by volcanic ash. But your stay will be much more modern. Bathrooms and electricity provide what you expect from a modern hotel, and the white volcanic ash, called tufa, keeps the rooms cool, about 65ºF in summer.

When she was seven or eight, she was sold as a slave to John and Susanna Wheatley of Boston. She was named after the ship that brought her to America, The Phillis. The family suppose the girl — who was “suffering from a change of climate,” with “no other covering than a dirty carpet”— to be “about seven years old … from the circumstances of shedding (使脱落) her front teeth.”        Phillis was very intelligent. The Wheatley family taught her to read and write, and encouraged her to write poetry. Her first poem On Messrs. Hussey and Coffin was published when she was only twelve. In 1770, An Elegiac Poem, on the Death of That Celebrated Divine, and Eminent Servant of Jesus Christ, the Reverend and Learned George Whitefield made her famous. It was published in Boston, Newport, and Philadelphia.        When she was eighteen, Phillis and Mrs Wheatley tried to sell a collection containing twenty-eight of Phillis’s poems. Colonists (殖民者) did not want to buy poetry written by an African. Mrs Wheatley wrote to England to ask Countess (女伯爵) of Huntingdon for help. The countess was a wealthy supporter of the abolition (废除) of slavery. Phillis had Poems on various subjects, religious and moral published in England in 1773. This book made Phillis famous in England and the thirteen colonies. She wrote a poem for George Washington in 1775, and he praised her work. They met in 1776. Phillis supported independence for the colonies during the Revolutionary War.        After her master died, Phillis was freed. She married John Peters, a free black man, in 1778. She and her husband lost two children. John was put into prison for debt in 1784. Phillis and her remaining child died in December of 1784 and were buried in an unmarked grave.        Phillis was the first African American and the first slave in the United States to publish a book. She was the first African American woman to earn a living from her writing. Phillis’ poetry proved the abolitionists’ idea that blacks could be artistic and intellectual. Her achievements were used to support a growing antislavery movement.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p style=\"text-indent:28px\"><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">本文是一篇记叙文，讲述了第一位出版诗集的美国黑人女诗人菲莉斯•惠特莉的故事。</span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":10875,\"main_id\":61246,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"The Wheatley family guessed the age of Phillis by ________.\",\"answer\":\"D. the condition of her teeth\",\"answer_a\":\"A. her weight\",\"answer_b\":\"B. her clothes\",\"answer_c\":\"C. her skin color\",\"answer_d\":\"D. the condition of her teeth\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">事实细节题</span> <span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">根据第一段中的</span><span style=\\\"font-size: 14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">to be </span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">“</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">about seven years old ... from the circumstances of shedding her front teeth.</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">”</span> <span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">可知</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">Wheatley</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">一家是根据她的牙齿状况看出她正是换牙的年龄，所以答案为</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">D</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">。</span></p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":10876,\"main_id\":61246,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"It can be inferred from the text that Countess of Huntingdon ________.\",\"answer\":\"B. helped Phillis get her writings published\",\"answer_a\":\"A. lived on writing poems\",\"answer_b\":\"B. helped Phillis get her writings published\",\"answer_c\":\"C. supported independence for the colonies\",\"answer_d\":\"D. felt surprised that Phillis could read and write\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">推理判断题</span> <span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">根据第三段中的</span><span style=\\\"font-size: 14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">Colonists did not want to buy poetry written by an African.

Scientists have traditionally been unwilling to identify the noises apes (猿) make as laughter, but research now suggests that they have been wrong. It turns out that apes do, in fact, laugh.        The analysis of the sounds from the laughter experiments showed that the ape noises were related to human laughter in the same way that ape genes are similar to human genes. In other words, ape laughter and human laughter developed in the same way many millions of years ago.        Although ape laughter and human laughter sound quite different, there are many similarities. The laughter of gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos sounds like fast breathing, or simply noisy breathing. Orangutan laughter is a series of quick snorts (哼声). Human laughter often sounds more pleasant than ape laughter, but humans have also been known to have laughter sounds that match the noises apes make.        The laughter of chimpanzees stood apart during the experiments because they laugh on both the inhale (吸入) and the exhale (呼出) of breath. Humans, gorillas, and bonobos, on the other hand, laugh only on the exhale. It takes longer than usual to exhale while laughing. Such laughter shows a type of breath control necessary for speech.

There was no shortage of material. Maida was fascinating as she talked about everything from picking grapes in her grandparents’ garden to avoiding wild dogs on her daily routine to school. The problem was finding the best form for the material.        Lautaro had already finished a rough cut that followed his grandmother’s story in time order. The video began with Maida’s earliest memories of the Italian farmyard and ended with her arrival in the United States at age 15, puzzled and excited. Lautaro used family photographs to illustrate (说明) Maida’s storytelling. He knew the first version was not bad, but he was not satisfied with the overall video. He was certain that something vital was missing.        Running out of his own ideas, Lautaro decided to get some advice. And who better to ask than Maida herself? Lautaro showed Maida the 10-minute video on his computer. As soon as it was over, Maida said, “I can’t get over how much things have changed, Taro. Your life seems so different from mine.” Maida’s words inspired Lautaro. Her reaction told him exactly what was missing: his personal point of view.        A few days later, when Lautaro screened his final project for his classmates and teacher, it was only two minutes longer than his original cut, but those extra minutes made a huge difference. Between Maida’s recollections of her past, Lautaro has added in photographs of his own life today. The contrasts were both striking and touching, and the final image of Lautaro listening to Maida reinforced (加强) the warmth comparative documentary with cheerful applause.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p style=\"text-indent: 28px\"><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">本文是一篇记叙文。为完成学校的一个课题，</span><span style=\"font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\">Lautaro</span><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">为祖母拍摄了一段录像短片，以此纪念祖母在意大利南部时的童年生活。当视频初步完成后，</span><span style=\"font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\">Lautaro</span><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">总觉得缺少些什么。在和祖母沟通后，他突然有所领悟，原来整个作品缺少的是他自己的观点态度。</span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":10941,\"main_id\":61270,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Which of the following events happened first?\",\"answer\":\"B.

There was no shortage of material. Maida was fascinating as she talked about everything from picking grapes in her grandparents’ garden to avoiding wild dogs on her daily routine to school. The problem was finding the best form for the material.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px;font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT\"><span style=\"font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 13px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Lautaro had already finished a rough cut that followed his grandmother’s story in time order.

And who better to ask than Maida herself? Lautaro showed Maida the 10-minute video on his computer. As soon as it was over, Maida said, “I </span><strong><span style=\"font-size:13px;font-family:TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT\">can’t get over </span></strong><span style=\"font-size:13px;font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT\">how much things have changed, Taro.

So, every day Ms. Cheng carries a bag of parcels, letters and documents of all shapes and sizes and does her rounds in North Point. She’s a courier (快递人员).        Five years ago, Ms. Cheng was a nurse at a private clinic. She had worked there for almost 30 years but was made jobless when the doctor migrated (移居). It was extremely difficult for her to find another job as a nurse. “People do not trust my ability when they learn how old I am,” she said. After two years of searching, the mother of two eventually found another nursing job. But then after two years, she quit. Why?      “My colleagues were young and they didn’t understand me because of my age. They often asked me, ‘You are so old, what are you working for?’ I was very unhappy.” she said. So while the rest of her family left for work, she was left to lonely boredom at home. Then, one of Ms. Cheng’s neighbours told her about Employee’s Retraining Board (ERB) offering retraining courses for older people on specific occupations, such as convenience store assistants, junior clerks and so on.      “I was interested in courier work. I didn’t think my age was a barrier because I was fit and healthy,” she said. Upon graduation from the ERB, Ms. Cheng was offered a job by the Speeding Shuttle Courier Service Company Limited. But then Ms. Cheng was caught between honour and employment. It took Ms. Cheng 24 hours to make up her mind and eventually she took heart and went off to work as a courier.        Ms. Cheng’s employer is delighted with her. “Ms. Cheng has been working with us for two months and has shown a good responsible attitude to work.” Anthony Chong, who runs the company, said. Mr. Chong said he hired older people because they were able and reliable. “Age is not an important factor but attitude is. Many old people are more capable than youngsters. They will not run from difficulties but young ones will,” he said. “It is not easy to recruit (招募) young people since they shy away from hardship and challenges.”","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p style=\"text-indent: 28px\"><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">本文是一篇记叙文。文章介绍了</span><span style=\"font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\">56</span><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">岁的程女士失业后努力找工作，却屡遭碰壁和不理解，直到她接受职业培训，在一家快递公司当快递人员，才实现了自我价值。</span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":10956,\"main_id\":61280,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Why was it difficult for Ms. Cheng to find another nursing job?\",\"answer\":\"C.

If you wish to make the most of your campus (校园) experience and become a better person after those four years, then first you ought to make friends. Close friends contribute to your self growth for they provide you with moral support that is so important to surviving the stressful college life. Friends can lend a helping hand when necessary like collecting your homework when you’re too sick to leave your dorm, and help you develop the right attitude by pointing out to you your weaknesses.        Being home most of your life and then suddenly finding yourself on your own in a large campus without your parents to hold your hand can be annoying. However, rather than thinking about your missing home too much, why not see this new stage in your life as an opportunity for self growth and develop the right attitude that will prepare you for the rigors of post-graduation life, particularly when you join the workforce?        Special-interest clubs or organizations are great for self growth. Here, not only do you get the opportunity to meet with like-minded people, you can also discover more things about your field of interest. Club meetings usually include lively discussions, so go there with the right attitude. You should try to build a good name in the organization by being respectful, active and considerate to others.        You might not like all of your professors, but they are there to provide knowledge you need to be successful in your chosen field. Thus, show up for each class with the right attitude and determination to learn. 1 Whether you get along well with your professors or not has a huge effect on your self growth as it is a measure of how well you can respect authority and obey requirements.        Actively participating in a class debate or lecture contributes to your self growth as it helps you build confidence in speaking up and improves your communication skills. It also helps you develop the right attitude by exercising diplomacy (外交术) when you choose your words carefully especially when discussing a very politically sensitive issue (问题) and exercising patience when dealing with classmates who shoot down your ideas.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p style=\"text-indent: 28px\"><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">本文是一篇说明文。当你迈入大学校门求学的时候，该如何在大学期间谋求自我发展呢？本文会给予你许多帮助。</span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":10966,\"main_id\":61291,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"In the author’s opinion, what can help college students develop a positive attitude?\",\"answer\":\"D.

       The 64-year-old, a former senior officer at the State Bank of India, talks about his disabled and wounded dogs like a father about his children — with the same love, affection, and warmth.        He’s a well-known animal rights activist, the Secretary at People for Animals (PFA). But nothing defines (界定) Mahendra better than his love for animals. It was this love that led him to establish India’s first shelter home for dogs living with disabilities.        It all started in 1998 when, while taking a midnight walk, Mahendra came across a very weak dog on the street. Mahendra decided to feed it and for the next couple of days it became the centre of his life, until the night when he found it dead.        Since then, Mahendra started providing treatment to all wounded and sick dogs he came across. After some time, somebody told Mahendra about PFA, which is India’s largest animal welfare organization, chaired by Mrs. Maneka Gandhi. Mahendra contacted her and, impressed by the work he was doing, Mrs. Gandhi asked him to start a PFA chapter in Ahmedabad.        Thus, in 2014, he started the shelter. It took a long time for Mahendra to find land where the shelter could be set up. Finally, Ramesh Bhai Patel, a farmer from a village named Jundal, agreed to give his land for free. Along with a team of four doctors and many volunteers, the shelter now has twenty-five dogs that were unable to walk at all when they were brought in. Today, they’re slowly healing (康复).        Dogs that have healed with proper treatment are sent back to where they came from if the environment there is safe. However, the shelter will be home to the paralytic (瘫痪的) and blind dogs for all their lives, says Mahendra.        The shelter runs on the money coming from Mahendra’s own pocket. He and his wife get a monthly pension of 45,000 rupees (卢比) each. There have been some financial crunches now and then but Mahendra is determined that no matter what challenges come their way, they’ll fight through.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p style=\"text-indent: 28px\"><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">本文是一篇记叙文。文章主要讲述了印度第一个残疾动物收容所的成立过程及现状。</span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":11074,\"main_id\":61320,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What is the most outstanding quality of Mahendra?\",\"answer\":\"B.

On May 2, Gadgil won the $100,000 Lemelson-MIT Award. Each year, the honor is given to an inventor who has improved the lives of people in developing countries. Gadgil’s inventions have helped more than 100 million people around the world.        Gadgil is a professor and physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. When he’s not teaching, he works to find solutions to global problems such as energy efficiency (效率) and water safety. “I chose to focus on problems where my knowledge of science could help,” Gadgil said.        In the 1980s, he came up with a program to make energy-efficient light bulbs more affordable for people in developing countries. Then in the 1990s, Gadgil designed his first life-saving invention, UV Waterworks. It kills deadly disease-carrying germs (病菌) from drinking water. It costs just one cent to clean five liters of water. Gadgil was inspired to find an inexpensive solution to the clean water crisis after more than 10,000 people in his home country of India died from an outbreak of Bengal cholera (霍乱), in 1993. The disease is spread through polluted food and drinking water.        So far, the invention has provided safe drinking water to more than 5 million people in India, Liberia, Nigeria, the Philippines and Ghana.        Families in refugee (难民) camps in Sudan are given food aid. But they still have to cook the meals. In order to do so, refugee women leave the safety of the camps three to five times a week to gather firewood. They walk up to seven hours a day to find enough wood to fuel their stoves. Cooking over an open flame can be dangerous to one’s healthand to the environment, too, because of the amount of smoke it produces. Gadgil visited the area many times with his students and his co-workers to work with the refugee women on designing a clean, fuel-efficient stove. The Berkeley-Darfur Stove he created saves 55% of fuel. That means the women wouldn’t have to leave the houses to find firewoodas often. The invention also helps to save homes more than $300 a year. About 125,000 women and their families have been helped.        As a professor, Gadgil encourages his students to stay positive about finding solutions to hard problems. “Be optimistic when you try a hard problem,” he says. “It’s when you solve a large problem that you can have a powerful effect on the world.”","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p><span style=\"font-family: 宋体\">本文是一篇记叙文。</span><span style=\"font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\">Ashok Gadgi</span><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">发明了一种用紫外线给水消毒的装置和节约能源的轻便烹调用炉，给一些发展中国家的人民带来了很大帮助。</span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":11107,\"main_id\":61330,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Gadgil was given Lemelson-MIT Award for ________.\",\"answer\":\"D. his helpful inventions\",\"answer_a\":\"A. his teaching experience\",\"answer_b\":\"B. his new research report\",\"answer_c\":\"C. his vast knowledge\",\"answer_d\":\"D. his helpful inventions\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">事实细节题</span> <span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">根据第一段可知，</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">Lemelson-MIT Award</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">是奖励给那些为改善发展中国家人民生活而进行发明创造的人。</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">Ashok Gadgil</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">也因此获奖。</span></p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":11108,\"main_id\":61330,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What can we learn about UV Waterworks?\",\"answer\":\"B.

The 19-year-old first started the project last summer as a free website to help people appeal unfair parking tickets. He came up with the idea after getting a series of tickets himself for unimportant reasons. Having wasted hours on writing appeals to these tickets, he realized that many people have no time or legal knowledge to appeal. So he decided to create a robot lawyer, which he named DoNotPay.        DoNotPay was a success, and the tech genius has gone a step further with the website, converting (转变) it into a robot lawyer equipped to help with various legal issues. “The robot can handle parking ticket appeals and delayed flights / trains. It can also answer some general legal questions like ‘I can’t afford my ticket. What do I do?’” said Browder.        To use the service, users need to go to the website donotpay.co.uk and sign up for free. Once signed in, the robot will ask the user questions about their situation. When it has collected enough information, and if the person has legal grounds (依据) for an appeal, the robot will create a letter for the person to use.        Browder said he received good advice from his professors at Stanford University. “Initially, I thought the best way to go about it was to create many individual rules for it to follow,” he explained. “However, I quickly failed with this approach because there are thousands of ways to say the same thing and it would be impossible to catch every one. The breakthrough came when I learned how to create a way for the robot to learn and compare phrases itself, so that it doesn’t matter how the user phrases his or her requests.”        So he programmed the robot to use text comparison that includes keywords, word order and pronouns. And the more people use the robot, the better the algorithm (演算法) gets. But there’re situations where the robot can’t help. “If the robot can’t answer, it provides helpful message offering the user some sample phrases or the choice of contacting me directly,” Browder said. “On the backend, whenever the robot can’t answer, I get notified and I work as quickly as possible to add functionality for any future requests of a similar nature.”","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p style=\"text-indent: 28px\"><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">本文是一篇说明文。英国程序员约书亚•布劳德只有</span><span style=\"font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\">19</span><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">岁，他开发的新程序——世界上第一个机器人律师，能帮人们省下不少法律费用。用户询问的一些法律问题，机器人程序都可以自动生成相关答案，而且此项服务是免费的。</span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":11112,\"main_id\":61341,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What made Joshua Browder decide to develop the robot lawyer?\",\"answer\":\"C.

The 19-year-old first started the project last summer as a free website to help people appeal unfair parking tickets. He came up with the idea after getting a series of tickets himself for unimportant reasons. Having wasted hours on writing appeals to these tickets, he realized that many people have no time or legal knowledge to appeal. So he decided to create a robot lawyer, which he named DoNotPay.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DoNotPay was a success, and the tech genius has gone a step further with the website, converting (转变) it into a robot lawyer equipped to help with various legal issues. “The robot can handle parking ticket appeals and delayed flights / trains. It can also answer some general legal questions like ‘I can’t afford my ticket. What do I do?’” said Browder.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To use the service, users need to go to the website donotpay.co.uk and sign up for free. Once signed in, the robot will ask the user questions about their situation. When it has collected enough information, and if the person has legal grounds (依据) for an appeal, the robot will create a letter for the person to use.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Browder said he received good advice from his professors at Stanford University. “Initially, I thought the best way to go about it was to create many individual rules for it to follow,” he explained. “However, I quickly failed with this approach because there are thousands of ways to say the same thing and it would be impossible to catch every one. The breakthrough came when I learned how to create a way for the robot to learn and compare phrases itself, so that it doesn’t matter how the user phrases his or her requests.”</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So he programmed the robot to use text comparison that includes keywords, word order and pronouns. And the more people use the robot, the better the algorithm (演算法) gets. But there’re situations where the robot can’t help. “If the robot can’t answer, it provides helpful message offering the user some sample phrases or the choice of contacting me directly,” Browder said. “On the backend, whenever the robot can’t answer, I get <span style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\">notified</span> and I work as quickly as possible to add functionality for any future requests of a similar nature.”</p><p><br/></p>"},{"id":61342,"word_id":0,"test_group":4,"check_point":4,"questions":0,"subject":"        Our children grew up on jelly (果酱) sandwiches.
