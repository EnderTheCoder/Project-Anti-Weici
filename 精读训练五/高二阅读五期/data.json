She was searching for her favorite songs so she could copy the lyrics down in a notebook. While daydreaming, Brown casually turned the dial on the radio until she heard something that made her stop. It was a voice that sounded familiar. Back in those days, news clips (新闻摘要) were played at movie theaters. Brown recognized the voice from one of the news films she had seen.        \"I heard Amelia Earhart in a panicked voice, a heartbreaking voice,” Brown recalled in a 2007 interview. “She was saying, ‘This is Amelia Earhart Putnam, please help me. Please hear me.’”        Brown quickly began writing down what she heard — parts of desperate conversations between the woman she believed was Earhart and an unknown man. Later, she decided that the man must have been Earhart’s navigator (领航员), Fred Noonan. As the signal faded in and out, Brown never left the radio. She scribbled (潦草地写) away as Earhart and Noonan struggled for control of the radio. Earhart tried to prevent Noonan from leaving the plane after they had apparently crash-landed. All the while, Earhart repeated strings of numbers and mentioned rising water. After about three hours, Earhart and Noonan were seemingly forced to abandon the plane as it was filled with water, and the distress calls (求救信号) stopped.        Brown and her father both tried to give her notes to the United States Coast Guard, but they were told the situation was under control. The search for Earhart was abandoned after a great effort was made, and Brown eventually stopped trying to tell people what she heard. But she kept her notebook. In 2000, people from an organization researching Earhart’s disappearance asked to see it. The researchers were convinced that Brown’s notes were reliable. If the researchers are right, the notes are a priceless, yet sorrowful, record of the sad ending of an American hero.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">本文是一篇记叙文。</span><span style=\"font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\">1937</span><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">年，美国著名女飞行员</span><span style=\"font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\">Amelia Earhart</span><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">在飞越太平洋期间神秘消失。当时</span><span style=\"font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\">15</span><span style=\"font-family: 宋体\">岁女孩</span><span style=\"font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\">Betty Brown</span><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">曾无意间接收到过</span><span style=\"font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\">Amelia Earhart</span><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">发出的求救信息并记录了下来。虽然</span><span style=\"font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\">Betty Brown</span><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">和她父亲将这些信息记录提供给了美国海岸防卫队，但并未得到重视，直到</span><span style=\"font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\">2000</span><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">年，这份记录的真实性才被相关研究人员予以肯定。</span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"第7周星期五","sub":"[{\"id\":10737,\"main_id\":59630,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Betty Brown stayed by the radio for so long because she _______.\",\"answer\":\"C. wanted to gather more information about Earhart’s situation\",\"answer_a\":\"A. was waiting for her music to come back on\",\"answer_b\":\"B. enjoyed recording people’s conversations\",\"answer_c\":\"C. wanted to gather more information about Earhart’s situation\",\"answer_d\":\"D. wanted to take notes for a book about Earhart\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">推理判断题</span> <span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">从第三段中的</span><span style=\\\"font-size: 14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">As the signal faded in and out, Brown never left the radio.</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">之后至本段段末内容可知，</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">Betty Brown</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">想记录下更多有关</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">Amelia Earhart</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">的信息。</span></p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":10738,\"main_id\":59630,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"From the Coast Guard’s reaction to Brown, we can infer that the Coast Guard _______.\",\"answer\":\"B. did not believe Brown heard Earhart\",\"answer_a\":\"A. did not want to look for Earhart\",\"answer_b\":\"B. did not believe Brown heard Earhart\",\"answer_c\":\"C. wanted Brown to help them find Earhart\",\"answer_d\":\"D. already knew where Earhart was\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">推理判断题</span> <span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">根据最后一段第一句</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">Brown and her father both tried to give her notes to the United States Coast Guard, but they were told the situation was under control.</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">可知，</span><span style=\\\"font-size: 14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">Brown</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">提供给美国海岸防卫队的信息并未得到重视，即他们不相信</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">Brown</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">接收到了</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">Amelia Earhart</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">发出的信息。</span></p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":10739,\"main_id\":59630,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Why did Brown most likely keep her notebook for so long?\",\"answer\":\"D.

She was searching for her favorite songs so she could copy the lyrics down in a notebook. While daydreaming, Brown casually turned the dial on the radio until she heard something that made her stop. It was a voice that sounded&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">familiar. Back in those days, news clips (</span><span style=\"font-family: 宋体;\">新闻摘要</span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">) were played at movie theaters. Brown recognized the voice from one of the news films she had seen.</span></p><p><font face=\"宋体\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&quot;</font><span style=\"font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\">I heard Amelia Earhart in a panicked voice, a heartbreaking voice,” Brown recalled in a 2007 interview. “She was saying, ‘This is Amelia Earhart Putnam, please help me. Please hear me.’”</span></p><p><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">Brown quickly began writing down what she heard — parts of desperate conversations between the woman she believed was Earhart and an unknown man. Later, she decided that the man must have been Earhart</span><span style=\"font-family: 宋体;\">’</span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">s navigator (</span><span style=\"font-family: 宋体;\">领航员</span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">), Fred Noonan. As the signal faded in and out, Brown never left the radio. She scribbled (</span><span style=\"font-family: 宋体;\">潦草地写</span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">) away as Earhart and Noonan struggled for control of the radio. Earhart tried to prevent Noonan from leaving the plane after they had apparently crash-landed. All the while, Earhart repeated strings of numbers and mentioned rising water. After&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">about three hours, Earhart and Noonan were seemingly forced to abandon the plane as it was filled with water, and the distress calls (</span><span style=\"font-family: 宋体;\">求救信号</span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">) stopped.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brown and her father both tried to give her notes to the United States Coast Guard, but they were told the situation was under control. The search for Earhart was abandoned after a great effort was made, and Brown eventually stopped trying to tell people what she heard. But she kept her notebook. In 2000, people from an organization researching Earhart’s disappearance asked to see it. The researchers were convinced that Brown’s notes were reliable. If the researchers are right, the notes are a priceless, yet sorrowful, record of the sad ending of an American hero.</span></p><p><br/></p>"},{"id":59635,"word_id":0,"test_group":4,"check_point":4,"questions":0,"subject":"        Columbus returned home with the news of his discovery of “Indian” as Columbus called it.

But new research suggests that too much sport for teenagers could negatively affect their well-being just as much as too little sport.        The US Department of Health and Human Services suggests that young people aged between 6 and 17 carry out at least 60 minutes of physical activity a day, 7 hours a week. But researchers from Switzerland say their study suggests that 14 hours of physical activity a week is best for promoting good health in teenagers. However, they found that more than 14 hours appears to be detrimental to their health. To reach their findings, the researchers surveyed more than 1,245 teenagers aged between 16 and 20 from Switzerland.        All participants were required to answer questions regarding height and weight, sports practice, sports injuries and well-being. Their well-being was assessed using the World Health Organization (WHO) Well-Being Index, which provides scores between 0 and 25. Of the participants, 50.4% were male with a mean age of 17.95 years. Almost 9% of these males were overweight. The overall average well-being score for all participants was 17.        The researchers divided sports participation into low (0-3.5 hours a week), average (3.6-10.5 hours), high (10.6-17.5 hours), and very high (more than 17.5 hours). The researchers found that participants in the low and very high activity groups were more than twice as likely to have well-being scores below 13, compared with participants in the average group. The researchers found that the highest well-being scores were gotten by participants who carried out around 14 hours of physical activity a week, but beyond 14 hours resulted in lower well-being scores.        Commenting on their findings, the researchers say physical activity has been associated with positive emotional well-being, reduced sadness, anxiety and stress disorders, and improved self-esteem (自尊) in teenagers.

The researchers found that participants in the low and very high activity groups were more than twice as likely to have well-being scores below 13, compared with participants in the average group.

Should we allow the Odeon Triplex Cinema to be constructed at the Havenswood Shopping Center? There is just one large lot left to build on, and the theater would use up all of that space. Some people are excited at the idea of finally having our own movie theater. Others would rather travel ten miles north to the nearest theater in Gadway in order to keep our quiet town the way it is. They say it is enough to have Marvin’s Movie Video Rentals in the shopping center, with lots of recent videos available.        There are certainly benefits of renting videos. For one thing, you can view movies when it is convenient for you. Besides, it is a less expensive way to view a movie compared to going to a theater.        On the other hand, seeing a movie in a theater is a different experience. For one thing, you can see the movie on a wide screen as the filmmaker planned. To be viewed on a television screen, a film must be changed in some way to make it smaller. One way is the “pan-and-scan” method, which involves removing some of the details in the picture. This results in an image that is not complete. The other way, “letterboxing”, keeps the image the way it is on the big screen, with one annoying exception: because the big-screen version is wide, the same picture on a television screen must be long and narrow, with black strips above and below it.        Another problem is sound. The sound from a television, even when it’s connected to a home stereo (立体声的) system, cannot compare with the sound system in a movie theater. Your experience of a movie improves when you can clearly hear all of the sounds. Furthermore, at home, viewing companions often talk during a movie, which makes you miss out on what’s happening in the film.

       People have used pigeons to carry messages to one another for hundreds of\nyears. In fact, pigeons were a common way to send messages right up through World\nWar II.         In 1815, English troops were fighting Napoleon’s forces in France, and the English\nwere believed to be losing. A financial panic swept over London. Government bonds (债券)\nwere offered at low prices. Few people noticed that Nathan Rothschild, an English banker,\nwas snapping up these bonds when everyone else was desperately trying to sell them. A\nfew days later, London learned the truth: the Duke of Wellington had defeated Napoleon\nat the battle of Waterloo. The value of the bonds soared (暴涨), and Rothschild became\nwealthy… all because his pigeons had brought him news of the victory before anyone else knew of it.         Carrier pigeons were used by countries in both World War I and World War II. Not only were the birds often the\nfastest, most reliable way to send messages, they could also be used to reach soldiers far behind enemy lines, where\nradios and field telephone lines were useless. Since they could easily be released from airplanes or ships, every branch\nof the armed services used the birds.         Carrying messages could be a dangerous job.

In 1918 American forces captured (捕捉到) a pigeon\nnamed The Kaiser, which had been trained to fly special missions for Germany, during battle. He was taken to\nAmerica, where he lived to the age of 32.         Today, modern communication methods can carry information from one place to another hundreds of times faster\nthan a pigeon could do it.

It seemed to take hours and I wasn’t sure he could bring the ancient auto back to life again this time. At long last, though, he closed the hood (引擎盖) and turned the key in the engine. There was a sweet smile of satisfaction on his face as the engine started. There was a twinkle of joy in his eye when he shook his head and refused to accept anything for his work. And there was happiness in his voice as we drove back home that day. This memory made a home in my heart and became a priceless pearl for my soul to <span style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\">cherish</span>. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Time and time again my dad showed me that a good life, a kind life, a giving life, and a heavenly life was created one choice at a time. Not all of his choices were the right ones, but most of them were. He did the best he could. He lived the best he could. And he helped to bring out the best in me too. As I look back into that treasure of memories my dad left me, I realize that each one of them inspired me to live and to love: one choice at a time. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>How do you build a better world: one choice at a time. How do you live a loving life: one choice at a time. How do you make Earth more like Heaven: one choice at a time. May all of your choices be driven by love, inspired by joy, and guided by God. And may all of your choices bring memories of happiness to those around you.</p>"},{"id":61295,"word_id":0,"test_group":3,"check_point":3,"questions":0,"subject":"        It was Sunday, so Dad and I were at the second-hand goods market, looking for tools, appliances, and other things that needed cleaning. Some were broken; others, like silver trays (托盘), just needed to be cleaned and polished. It was 1974, and the recession (萧条) was in full swing. Dad worked full-time at a factory, but the money wasn’t enough. Dad had tried a second job for a while, but he found it was still too hard for the family. One day, he had an excellent idea that set me on a lifelong course of self-sufficiency (自给自足).        Standing beside a crowded table at the second-hand goods market, I looked over an ancient manual sewing machine. Someone had changed it to run on electric power. It was way older than Mom’s machine, but it looked like it had quality and longevity built into it. “Dad!” I called. “This is a beaut!”        Dad walked over, pulling a cart (手推车) full of audio equipment, tools, worn-out appliances, and what appeared to be a block of dull kitchen knives. “What have you got, Son?” I described what I saw and what I figured I could do to fix the beauty up. Dad paid for my discovery, and we headed home.        Every day after school I worked on the ancient machine, and every night Dad and I sharpened tools and knives, sanded off rust (锈), polished metal, and replaced missing parts from various items.

Fans are hosting a birthday party in the house in northern England where Charlotte and her sisters Emily and Anne grew up and wrote their books. The anniversary reflects the global popularity of the Brontes, whose works are seen as among the most important ever written by female authors. A wreath (花环) will be laid for Bronte in Westminster Abbey tomorrow and a ballet version (版本) of Jane Eyre is opening next month, while the National Portrait Gallery is hosting an exhibition in her honour.        The Bronte Parsonage Museum in Haworth, a remote village in Yorkshire, draws tens of thousands of visitors from around the world each year, and the sisters’ books are an important part of British bookshops and school curriculums.        Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bronte were a clergyman’s (牧师) daughters who wrote for pleasure and dreamt of becoming published authors but feared they would not be taken seriously because they were women. They therefore adopted the pen names of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell when they sent Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall to publishers in the 1840s.        Emily Bronte fell ill and died in 1848, followed by Anne the following year. Charlotte lived for a further six years before dying in Haworth in 1855 at age 38. Jane Eyre, which has never been out of print in Britain, tells the story of Jane Eyre’s youth as an orphan (孤儿) and how she falls in love with her employer, Mr Rochester, while working as a teacher.        Charlotte Bronte’s other works include Shirley and Villette. Her biographer Claire Harman told the BBC this month that she was someone “who longed to be forever known, but relied on anonymity (匿名) in order to achieve it; a woman much more concerned about truthfulness than personal fame and someone who put into words her own terrible sufferings ... as being the only way to deal with them.”","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">本文是一篇记叙文，介绍了夏洛特诞辰</span>200<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">周年的纪念活动，并简单介绍了她们三姐妹的生平以及别人对她的评价。</span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"第6周星期五","sub":"[{\"id\":11018,\"main_id\":61306,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What does the underlined word “marked” in paragraph 1 mean?\",\"answer\":\"C.
