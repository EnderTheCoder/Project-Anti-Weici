        One day Columbus was at ### and several of these fellows were ### , too. They tried to make Columbus ### .“You have discovered strange lands beyond the sea,” they said. “But we don’t see ### there should be so much said about it. Anybody can coast along the ### on the other side, just as you have done. It is the ### thing in the world.”
        Columbus made no ### , but after a while he took an egg from a dish and said to the people at the table, “Who ### you, gentlemen can make the egg stand on ### ?” One by one they tried the ### . When the egg had gone entirely around and everyone had ### , all said that it could not be done. Then Columbus took the egg and ### the shell (壳) of the egg’s small end a little upon the table.

Anybody can do it — AFTER HE HAS BEEN SHOWN ### .”
