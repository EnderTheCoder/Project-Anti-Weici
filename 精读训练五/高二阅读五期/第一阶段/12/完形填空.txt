题目:        The changing point in my life came when I was in London. I had to ### the weekend in the city centre for an exam. It was a ### apartment and I only had enough money for it.
        One day walking to my living area, I was ### by a young woman. She promised she wasn’t a beggar (乞丐) and ### she just had no food for her baby.
        I just ### her as a beggar. In my pocket I had one pound eighty pence in change and a twenty-pound note. This was the ### of my money for the rest of the weekend. I gave her the change and ### on. Then I heard her saying something and I turned ### . “Sorry, but this isn’t going to buy much baby food, is it?”
        For a second her words really made me ### . After all, her baby wasn’t my ### . Part of my mind screamed that she was just trying to take me for a ### .
        But what if she wasn’t?
        There and then I had to ### what kind of person I was going to be. Would I keep myself from being taken advantage of — and ### miss the chance of helping a person in ### ? Or would I ### people to take advantage of me nine times out of ten to make sure I ### the tenth time?
        I ### that if I lived with a(n) ### heart the people who took advantage of me would not be winning over me. They would be losing because of the life they ### to live.
      “Please tell the ### ,” I said to the woman and gave her the twenty pounds.
        I’ve been living by that decision twenty years now — and never regretted it once.
