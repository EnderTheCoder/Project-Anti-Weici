       Although it is often called the koala “bear”, this lovely animal is not actually a bear at all. It is a marsupial (有袋目哺乳动物), and like kangaroos, a female koala carries her baby in her pouch (育儿袋) for about six months.         Koalas live in four states only in eastern Australia, where the eucalyptus (桉树) trees they love are most plentiful. In fact, they rarely leave these trees, their sharp claws easily keeping them high up in the air.         During the day they sleep for up to 18 hours. When not asleep, they feed on eucalyptus leaves, especially at night. Koalas do not drink much water and they get most of their water from these leaves. Each animal eats a large amount for its size — about two and a half pounds of leaves a day, even storing snacks of leaves in pouches.         The koala bears were widely hunted during the 1920s and 1930s and their populations decreased suddenly. Helped by reintroduction, they have reappeared over much of their former range, but their populations are smaller. Koalas need a lot of space — about a hundred trees per animal — which is a pressing problem, as Australia’s woodlands continue to get smaller because the trees they live on are being cut down to make farms. Also, forest fires, caused by heat waves, are destroying the forests the koalas live in.         It has been estimated (估算) that there are only 100,000 koalas left in the wild, with the lowest estimates being no more than 43,000. The koala can only eat eucalyptus leaves and lives nowhere else except Australia, so in order to survive, human effect on its limited environment must be controlled, or this attractive creature faces certain extinction.

Are you tired of hearing your kids complain about how animals in the same old petting zoos are monotonous? Consider This: The fact is that most mammals (哺乳动物) are boringly warm, furry, and come in a limited range of dull colours. Reptiles, on the other hand, are cold-blooded and covered with scales (鳞) of attractive colours, from bright green to bright red to dark purple-red. Some, like the chameleon, can even CHANGE colors. Did you ever see a rabbit with scales and a purple tongue almost as long as its body? NO! In our zoo, you can see pet skinks (蜥蜴), snakes, bearded dragons, and other attractive creatures! Learn what these reptiles eat and how they care for their babies, which ones live in the desert and which live in wetlands, which ones are meat-eaters and which are vegetarians, which ones are deadly poisonous and which are not.

       After traveling ten years and hundreds of millions of kilometers, a small probe (探测器) has for the first time landed on the surface of a comet (彗星), a solar system object made of ice and rock.        The probe was sent from the European Space Agency’s main Rosetta spaceship early Wednesday, November 12, 2014. The spaceship is designed to carefully study the appearance and materials that make up Comet 67P.         The Philae research probe left its mother ship Rosetta and then began a trip toward the comet and landed on its surface hours later. The effort to land on the comet was considered dangerous not only because scientists were unsure of the surface, but because there were problems with thrusters (推进器) used to land the probe.         Scientists and many officials gathered at the European Space Agency’s Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany. After the landing was announced, there was cheering.         Rosetta has been orbiting Comet 67P since August 2014. However, it was sent up into space in March of 2004. The spaceship circled the sun until it was in position to meet with the comet.         Comets are the most primitive (原始的) objects in the solar system. Scientists think that they have kept a record of the physical and chemical processes that occurred during the early period when planets were formed. By studying Comet 67P’s make-up and history, scientists wish to unlock the secret of the solar system and even the origin of human lives.         The Philae probe did a series of scientific experiments. Philae examined the materials that make up the comet looking for organic (有机的), or carbon-based materials, and inorganic materials. It lasted until March 2015, when the comet was too close to the sun and the surface temperature was too high for Philae to operate.

       Astronaut Scott Kelly has been living on the International Space Station (ISS) since March 28, 2015. And just like any other home, the ISS requires some housekeeping, in the form of regular work and repairs.        That is why Kelly and his partner Kjell Lindgren performed activities, outside the station on Wednesday. The operation began at 8:03 am and lasted for more than seven hours. It was the first spacewalk for both men.        The ISS has been in continual use for 15 years, and has hosted over 200 people, including astronauts and private tourists. During their activities, Kelly and Lindgren did basic electrical work, such as attaching new wires that will provide power to docking ports (接轨舱门) on the station. The ports will be used when other people arrive at the ISS. Also, the two astronauts fixed a thermal (防寒的) cover on a key scientific instrument on the station to protect it from the freezing temperatures of space.        As the more senior astronaut, Kelly led the spacewalk. However, Lindgren dealt with some of the more challenging parts of the job as he has longer arms than Kelly.        During a spacewalk, the simplest work becomes a difficult task. Kelly and Lindgren spent months training and practicing for the operation. The preparation began in NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL). Here astronauts are made to work in an environment similar to the one outside the space station.        Even getting the space suits ready can take days. While each suit is built to fit the astronaut perfectly who will wear it, adjustments (调整) need to be made right up to the time when the spacewalk begins. The adjustments address any changes in the astronauts’ bodies that have occurred as a result of being in a gravity-free environment.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p>本文是一篇说明文，文章主要介绍了两名美国宇航员走出国际空间站，展开空间站日常维护的工作。</p>","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":11297,\"main_id\":61460,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Why did Kelly and Lindgren take the spacewalk?\",\"answer\":\"D.

When Professor Vilas Pol and his research assistants were setting up their new laboratory, they found the boxes the equipment came in were filled with hundreds of little pieces known as packing peanuts.         Packing peanuts are a popular and effective way to protect all sorts of items that are easily broken or damaged — from TVs to dishes — when they’re being moved, stored or delivered. Unfortunately, most packing peanuts end up being buried under the earth where they can take decades to break down. When they do break down, they polluted the soil and water with chemicals.         Professor Pol, a chemical engineer, asked his team to help find a better way to deal with old packing peanuts. The scientists discovered that when they heated the peanuts — between 500 and 900 degrees Celsius — they turned into a carbon-based material that could be flattened into very thin sheets. These microsheets can be used to make anodes (正极), a key part of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (锂离子电池).         Anodes are usually made from a kind of carbon. However, anodes made from recycled packing peanuts are cheaper to make, less harmful to the environment, and work better than traditional carbon anodes.

He would write a poem and a song about the great tree, so common in Canada and so symbolic, to celebrate Canada’s Confederation (联邦).        His song was called The Maple Leaf Forever and it has been the unofficial Canadian anthem (国歌) to this day.        Last July during a major storm, the tree was knocked down. It fell across a house and a street. But because it was an important historic tree, most of the wood was saved rather than being destroyed.        Recently woodworkers at The Evergreen Brick Works in Toronto, a community projects centre, cut the wood into logs and other usable pieces. The pieces were given to artists to create about 150 different projects.        One artist took a piece of tree. On it, he’ll carve (雕刻) a series of historical Canadian scenes. Another wood carver is making beautiful round wooden bowls. Yet another made an interesting candlestick from the tree’s branches.        Other woodworkers are making wood wig stands (假发架) for cancer patients who lose their hair. Still others are taking small pieces of wood and making them into pens. And some of the wood was made into gavels (小木槌) to be used by Toronto’s city councilors (市议员).        Some of the projects will be on public show while some will be personally owned.        The people in Toronto who lived near the tree for years and tried to protect it from harm were very sad to see the old tree go.

He would write a poem and a song about the great tree, so common in Canada and so symbolic, to celebrate Canada’s Confederation (联邦).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His song was called The Maple Leaf Forever and it has been the unofficial Canadian anthem (国歌) to this day.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Last July during a major storm, the tree was knocked down. It fell across a house and a street. But because it was an important historic tree, most of the wood was saved rather than being destroyed.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recently woodworkers at The Evergreen Brick Works in Toronto, a community projects centre, cut the wood into logs and other usable pieces. The pieces were given to artists to create about 150 different projects.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One artist took a piece of tree. On it, he’ll carve (雕刻) a series of historical Canadian scenes. Another wood carver is making beautiful round wooden bowls. Yet another made an interesting candlestick from the tree’s branches.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Other woodworkers are making wood wig stands (假发架) for cancer patients who lose their hair. Still others are taking small pieces of wood and making them into pens. And some of the wood was made into gavels (小木槌) to be used by Toronto’s city councilors (市议员).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some of the projects will be on public show while some will be personally owned.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The people in Toronto who lived near the tree for years and tried to protect it from harm were very sad to see the old tree go. But they are glad to see that their maple tree will live forever in the hearts and homes of many people.</p>"},{"id":61724,"word_id":0,"test_group":3,"check_point":3,"questions":0,"subject":"A Cappella CompetitionDo you love to sing?Come and show off your talents at the Chilton Youth A Cappella Competition﹥ October 20th, 11:00 – 17:00﹥ Edward Greatcoat Theater, Sealey Road, Chilton﹥ RulesPlease remember that this is a cappella (清唱) competition!No instruments or recorded music will be allowed.Competitors may sing published or original (原创的) songs in any style.Competitors must be between 8 and 15 years old.There are four categories (类):﹥ Solo (独唱) (8 – 11 years old) ﹥ Solo (12 – 15 years old)﹥ Group (8 – 11 years old)\t\t﹥ Group (12 – 15 years old)★ Competitors under 12 years old must stay with a parent or other adult at all times.★ Each competitor must pay an entry (参赛) fee of $10.★ Winners will receive $500 and a course of 20 lessons with famous voice coach Vickie Leonard.★ Winners will be decided by three judges from the Chilton School of Music.
