题目:        Fifty years ago on a hot July 4th afternoon, an agent showed us a house in the South Farmingdale-North Massapequa area. My husband and I liked the house. The price was ### our reach. So we made our decision to buy it. 
        But there was one issue. It was a corner property (房产). We both agreed there had to be a ###. So after moving in, my husband put up a fence and I painted it ###. 
        There have been many ### in our lives since that fence went up. Our four children have grown up and ###. Most of the old ### have been replaced with new ones. ###, the fence remains, and, at the moment, so do I. 
        The fence has been ### more often than I can remember. Most times a broken board or two was ### repaired. During the past ten years, it has been repainted professionally. 
        But more ###, the white fence had turned green with mildew (霉菌). The boards were too old to paint. So this spring I had it rebuilt and repainted. Within a week, however, I was ### to discover that a part of it was destroyed. A post (桩) was ### and some boards were left lying on the ground. I don’t know who or what did this. 
        The fence is ### a thing, not a life, but for the first time in the years I had spent on my corner, I felt defeated (被 打败). I felt as if possibly there was a(n) ###: Time to move on, stop trying. Defeat is not usually part of my makeup. This time it was. 
        As I was taking a photo of the damage for a police report, a young man ### me from across the street. He ### himself as a relatively new neighbor, and offered sympathy (同情) for the ###. I appreciated meeting him, and also his ###. 
        The next evening as I ate my dinner, I heard a ### outside. When I walked into the yard, I realized the sounds came from my property. As I walked closer, I saw the neighbor I had just ### repairing my fence. 
        There were still warm-hearted people who loved our community and reached out to a stranger in my time of need.
