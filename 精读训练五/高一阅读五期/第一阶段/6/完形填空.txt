题目:        There was a rich and clever boy. One afternoon, his father bought him an old mirror from a mysterious old man. When ### arrived home, the boy went to see his reflection (影像) in it. His face looked very ### indeed. He tried ###, but his reflection remained sad-looking. 
         ###, the boy went off to buy sweets and toys. He came home, as ### as possible to look in the mirror, but he still looked sad in it. The boy got very ### and left it in a corner. 
        That same ### he went into the street to play. On his way to the park he saw a little boy. The boy was crying so much that the rich boy went over to ### him. The little one told him that he had ### his parents. 
        Together the two boys set off in search of them. As the little boy wouldn’t stop ### , the rich boy spent his money buying him sweets to cheer him up. Finally, after much ###, they found his parents who were out looking for him, very ###. 
        The rich boy said goodbye, and walked towards ###. But, seeing the time, he decided to turn round and head for home, without having been able to ###. At home, he went to his room and ### a shining light in the corner he’d left the mirror in. Seeing this, he went over to the mirror, and realized the ### was coming from his own body — he looked happy in the mirror this time! Then he ### the mystery of that mirror — it could reflect (反映) the true ### of its owner. He realized it was ###: he felt really happy to have helped that little boy.
