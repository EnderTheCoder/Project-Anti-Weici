题目:        Lisa had just gotten off the plane in Tampa, Florida last weekend after visiting her brother Greg in Columbus. She’d spent the week ### the 48-year-old Army veteran (退伍军人) after his risky operation. 
        Everything seemed fine when she ### — but after the plane landed she heard an alarming voicemail from Greg who said he was in extreme ###. 
        The veteran had no ### to get to the hospital in a taxi, and wasn’t sure if ambulance (救护车) fees were covered by his ###, so he gave his sister the contact information of his social worker, and Lisa ### dialed the phone number. 
        A young man named Jason Voss ###, and Lisa told him who she was, why she was calling, and asked how to get Greg to the hospital. The man said he had ### on hand and would send one of them to help. 
        Fifteen minutes later, Lisa got a call from someone named Zach, who said he would be able to give Greg a ### — all he needed was a phone number and ###. 
        Upset and ###, Lisa was mad at the man, demanding to know why he didn’t have this ### on file (档案). Zach simply responded by saying, “You ### Jimmy John’s.” 
        After a few ### moments of silence, Lisa confirmed that it was indeed the local sandwich restaurant before ### the mistake. Zach insisted (坚持) he still wanted to take her brother to the hospital — he just needed the address. 
        Because he, himself, is also a veteran, he took extra gentle care of the ### man, who was later that evening given a free taxi ride home from the ###, and is now doing fine. 
        Lisa has since expressed her great ### towards the sandwich restaurant. The restaurant manager, Jason Voss, said that he didn’t hesitate (犹豫) to ### the worried woman. Furthermore, he believes that anyone would have done the same thing if they were in his shoes — he just happened to be the one who ### the phone.
