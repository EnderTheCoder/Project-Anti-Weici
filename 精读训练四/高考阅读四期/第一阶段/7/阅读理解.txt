题目:        People have strong opinions about girls playing sports that historically have been played by boys, such as football, boxing, and wrestling. The feelings can be just as powerful when a boy wants to play on his school’s girls’ volleyball or field hockey team. Most of the people who are interested, no matter what their opinions are, tend to talk about fairness and opportunity. They all seem to want what is best for young people who love sports, but they do not always agree on what that means or how best to achieve it.        Until the 1970s, sports were often thought of as a boys’ activity, especially once children reached middle and high schools. In 1972, a new federal law was passed. The law had many parts, including a requirement that public schools and colleges offer equal sports programs for boys and girls. Because of this law, many schools began offering more sports for girls. Since 1972, many of those girls have grown up to play sports in college and even on professional teams. However, under the law, equal does not mean exactly the same. For example, a school may have a softball team for girls, but baseball for boys, or football only for boys and volleyball only for girls. But what if a girl wants to play on a boys’ sports team or a boy wants to try out for a sport that only has a girls’ team?        People who do not want girls on boys’ teams often say it could be dangerous. On average, girls tend to be shorter and weigh less than boys. Especially at the high school level and beyond, for contact sports like football, some parents and coaches think girls could be injured when playing with boys who outweigh them by 20, 40, or even 60 pounds. Others will reply that there is always a smallest, lightest boy on every team, too. They may say that girls who are willing to take the risk should be allowed to play.        Another worry about boys playing against girls is that the boys’ bigger size may give them an unfair advantage over girls.        Others think that girls may be nervous with boys on the team, even if the boys are not actually better players. Still, many people think boys as a group are louder and more aggressive when playing sports. They want girls to feel comfortable learning skills without worrying about boys’ behavior. But others may point out that some boys prefer to have a space that is for boys only, too. They explain that having a girl on the football team may cause the boys to feel or act differently. It could change traditions of those teams and the relationships of the players.        Having boys and girls excited about playing sports is a great thing — that is something everyone can agree on. However, it does leave schools, parents, and players with a tough question. When it comes to sports, just what is considered fair?
