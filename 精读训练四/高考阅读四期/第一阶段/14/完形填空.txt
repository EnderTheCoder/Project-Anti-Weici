题目:        I lived in Dallas, Texas nearly all my life with my mom, dad and older sister. We were ### to respect others, value education, and get all that we could out of life. My parents always say, “### hard and the world is yours.” They are never without a ### word of advice or a bit of encouragement when life gets tough.
        My parents always ### me to go to college. However, when I ### at 16 years old that I’d rather get married to a man than go to college, they ### stopped telling me they loved me and I could do anything I wanted to. ### , they persuaded me. I graduated from high school and currently ### the University of Oklahoma studying medicine. I want to make the ### a better place to live in.
        Every time I call home to tell them about a ### I received in Chemistry Lab or Microeconomics or whichever ### it is that I’m working hardest for at the moment, they tell me how ### of me they are. I know there are college kids out there that have no one to call home when they get an “A” on a project and I feel unbelievably ### to have my parents.
        Don’t get me wrong: We’ve had our share of ### . I was the angry teenager and they were the awful ### that wouldn’t let me stay out all night or let me get my tongue pierced (扎洞). But somehow, we ### to work through those issues (问题). They never ### loving me or believing in me.
        I ### everything I am to my parents. Without their ### love and encouragement, I wouldn’t believe I can change the world. My parents taught me to always ### for what I believe in. So I’m working toward something really great and can only hope I continue to make them proud.
