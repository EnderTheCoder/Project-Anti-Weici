题目:        In 2000, I was on holiday with my friends on the island of Corfu, Greece. One night we were walking along the main road that was lined on both sides with bars and nightclubs and it was very ### , maybe 11:30 pm. But I ### some Gypsy (吉卜赛的) children, young girls and boys ### roses to drunk tourists and gangs of girls out for the night!
        I felt sad when I saw one boy walk into the bar I was in and walked around ### flowers to the people in the bar. He wasn’t troubling others, ### asking; I refused but thanked him, so the boy moved on to the next ### . Just as the boy was leaving the ### a barman snatched (夺走) the roses off the boy and tore them up! The boy looked ### and then stared at the barman with a ### that I have never seen from a child. The barman thought it was funny ### but the boy just stared at him and he ### laughing and tried to give the boy some Coca Cola. The boy just ignored the ### and looked at the barman with a look that was far too old and spoke of the ### life he must have had.
        The boy then picked up what was left of the ### in his bucket (提桶) and made his ### out of the bar. I thought, “He is going to be in ### now. He may come back without the money and may get beaten.” ### I got up and ### the boy out of the bar, tapped him on the shoulder and put a 20,000 drachma ($50) note in his hand. He just looked at me ### and then I walked back into the bar, sat down, took a drink of my beer and ### to myself. Maybe in that moment the boy realized that not everyone was cruel.
