题目:        For many of us, the idea of devoting a whole evening a week to learning a language is a terrifying prospect (前景), as is opening a new set of books and CDs.        Babbel is a comprehensive learning system that allows the user to make learning part of his or her everyday life. Launched in 2007 in Berlin, it’s created and maintained (维护) by a team of 300 employees from 28 nations, including linguists, language teachers, native speakers, and authors.        The 14 language courses on offer are designed to be used on the go, anywhere and at any time, thanks to Babbel’s multi-platform mobile apps. These are free to download and contain 2,000–3,000 vocabulary words per language, pronounced by native speakers and accompanied by relevant images.         This native-speaker approach, says Markus Witte, CEO and founder of Babbel, is key to the company’s success. “The courses are designed by experienced language teachers and linguists,” he explains. “Their knowledge about learning processes and language pairings is extremely important when designing lessons. We offer 14 learning languages for seven mother tongues and it makes a huge difference whether a Portuguese or an English native learns Spanish.”        One of the real joys is being able to set your own pace and learn what you want and when you want to. Simply choose the language you want and start learning it right away with integrated speech recognition (综合的语音识别系统).        Registration with Babbel is completely free, as is one beginner and advanced lesson in every language, so you can start making progress immediately. If you choose to sign up you are offered monthly, three-monthly, six-monthly or yearly payment plans and this gives you immediate access to your chosen language on www.babbel.com as well as via the mobile apps for Android or iOS.        For many of us, the commitment of an evening’s work is the last thing we want after a full day. So if you don’t have the hours to put in, Babbel lets you save your completed lessons in the Cloud so you can pick up where you left off. You are also allowed to repeat a course or lesson as many times as you like and, if you miss the pleasure of formal education, you can even get a certificate for every course you complete. Babbel’s real goal, says Witte, is to have its learners ready for using their new language in real life after just a few lessons.
