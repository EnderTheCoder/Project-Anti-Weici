题目:        It was Christmas time at Gallaudet University in Washington, DC. The campus was ### deserted, so I was almost alone. I just could not afford to fly home.
        On one rainy afternoon, feeling ### , I dragged myself to a nearby post office to send a package home. I normally ### a hearing aid from early in the morning until bedtime in the evening. That day, I ### did not want to hear anything, so I left my hearing aid in my dormitory room.
        Inside the post office, each ### had a line of at least a dozen people. I was ### in one of the lines, when the door swung open. In came a boy, perhaps 12 years old. He was selling ### of the Washington Post for ten cents each. He went up to each person and ### a newspaper for sale. Person after person, line after line — no one would buy. Most people ### not to notice him. Finally, he came up to me. I told him that I didn’t need the ### because my college reading room was always supplied with newspapers. He left me and went on to other people.
        No one bought any of his newspapers, and I started to feel some sort of ### about him. I ### my pocket and found a quarter. I motioned (做动作示意) for him to ### and gave him my quarter. He ### me the paper, and I told him that I didn’t need it. He looked at me, ### , then started shouting words I could neither hear nor understand.
          ### , all the unknown people in the post office turned in my direction and smiled. It was an unexpected and astonishing moment. Whatever he said must have been ### . He had no way to know what effect his shouted thanks would have on me; no way to know my ### that Christmas. Whoever he was, he had a choice — and he chose to thank me in a way which altered (改变) my ### completely. I’ll never forget his incredible thank you, for it changed an otherwise ### Christmas into one of my finest.
