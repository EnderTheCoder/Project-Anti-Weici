题目:        Today we spent the morning going through our personal belongings. We were looking for items to ### for free, at a local park. Not just any items but things people really ### . Our aim was not to find things we no longer ### , but things we use every day that would be ### to others.
        We packed these things into ### and added some small toys. We added a list of local addresses and phone numbers of local ### agencies. Inside the boxes a simple letter was placed. It ### : 
      “Please take these items and know that your life is important. ### are difficult but these days will pass. We share what we have believing that it will ### . Use the food to nurture (给……营养) your ### ; use the blankets to stay warm. Be safe and know that the human ### can overcome anything. Do not hold your head ### for having a need to stay warm. Someday please do the same when you can.”
        This kind ### was not because the phone rang or for any reason. It was ### because it was the right thing to do. We have often seen ### people at the park where we left the belongings. I ### that my wife had put her favorite green coat into one of the boxes. I asked if she was ### about it and she just replied that it had a hood (兜帽). Her answer told me why it is her that I love. She liked the coat but knew the hood could ### someone from the rain.
        Who knows where these gifts of ### will go? How many uses can a blanket serve ### what it was designed to do? We never go back and see what happens. It’s unimportant. The right things will find the right people and that is all that counts.
