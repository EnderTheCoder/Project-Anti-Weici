题目:        In the opinion of some people, the most direct, most touching, and easiest way of protecting wild animals, without doubt, is “the rescue of each individual (个体的) wild animal”. On seeing a recovered bird return to the blue sky, they will feel moved with hot tears in the eyes.        However, what is very easily ignored by them is that the value of protecting each individual wild animal usually does not lie in the individual wild animal itself, but more frequently in the entire species (物种) behind each individual. In this aspect, this is different from the rescue of weak individuals in the human society.        There are many differences between animals and human beings. According to biologist Richard Dawkins, the biggest difference possibly lies in that animals are short of social culture. But here, the culture refers to “the behavior pattern having nothing to do with heredity (遗传), but which may be copied and inherited (继承)”.        Human beings depend on culture for heritage. As time passes by, the culture has been accumulated to distinguish one group from another. Therefore, the protection of culture is important and necessary. However, wild animals depend on genes for heritage, and therefore, it is important and necessary to keep natural genes in existence. As long as wild animals can pass genes down, the entire species survive.        Therefore, wild animals’ value mostly lies in its gene, and the existence of the species is more important. The individual death cannot be avoided, but the gene may exist forever through the gene bank of the species, keeping the species existent.        When we protect wild animal individuals, this is more a measure than a goal. Therefore, the Yellowstone Park has introduced the wolf to control the number of deer and get rid of the old, weak, sick and disabled. Such behavior is beyond imagination among human beings, but in the nature, this is completely normal and reasonable. We often observe wild animals with the judgment that we may have to human beings, ignoring their differences.        But if species itself is not in danger, then working hard to protect the individual can do nothing good to the entire species. Of course for other reasons, we still hope to protect these individuals from death, but this does not belong to the narrow sense of animal protection.
