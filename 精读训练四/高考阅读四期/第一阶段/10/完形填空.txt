题目:        We come by business naturally in our family. Each of the seven children in our family worked in our father’s store. As we worked and watched, we ### that work was more than ### and making a sale.
        One lesson stands out in my mind. It was shortly before Christmas. I was in eighth grade and was working evenings, straightening the toy section. A little boy, five or six years old, came in. He was wearing a torn and loose coat with ### sleeves. His shoes were scuffed (磨损) and his one shoelace was torn. The little boy looked poor to me — too poor to ### to buy anything. He looked around the toy section, picked up this item (物品) and that, and ### put them back in their place.
        Dad came down the stairs and walked over to the boy. His steel blue eyes ### and the dimple (酒窝) in his cheek stood out as he ### the boy what he could do for him. The boy said he was looking for a Christmas ### for his brother. I was impressed that Dad treated him with the same ### as any adult. Dad told him to take his ### and look around. He did.
        After about 20 minutes, the little boy picked up a toy plane, walked up to my dad and said, 
      “How much for this, Mister?”
      “How much have you ### ?” Dad asked.
        The little boy held out his hand and ### it. His hand was creased (起皱) with ### lines of dirt from holding his ### too tightly. In his hand lay only 27 cents. The ### on the toy plane he’d ### was $3.98.
      “That’ll just ### it,” Dad said as he made the sale. Dad’s reply still ### in my ears. When the little boy walked out of the store, I didn’t ### the worn coat or the single torn shoelace. What I saw was a happy child with a ### .
