题目:        Life in space will certainly take some getting used to! But the space station has been designed to keep the astronauts as comfortable as possible — the modules (舱) are roomy, bright, and kept at a constant 21℃. It’s important the crew members are comfortable because they’ll be busy aboard the station. In a typical workday, crew members will spend 14 hours working and exercising, 1.5 hours preparing and eating meals, and 8.5 hours sleeping. Here are some other fun facts about life aboard the station:Food        Come mealtime, astronauts will have a special dining kitchen. Space food just keeps getting better — and more like food we enjoy here on Earth. In early space missions (任务), astronauts could eat only freeze-dried food that didn’t require any preparation. But the space station is equipped with water, microwave ovens, and refrigerators, allowing the folks on board to eat more “normal” types of food, including fruit, vegetables, and ice cream!Sleep        Each crew member has a private room. With no gravity, they’ll need to tie themselves to their beds, or they will float away! That might sound like a strange way to sleep, but astronauts from past space missions report that sleeping in space is actually pretty great!Exercise        You might not think it, but exercise is even more important on the station than it is on Earth. There is not much gravity in space. Astronauts don’t stand up, sit down or walk in space, so their muscles and bones don’t have to work much — and this muscle and bone loss can be dangerous back on Earth. To fight this, astronauts on the station will exercise on bikes, rowing machines, and other equipment about two hours every day.Clothing        Astronauts will have to wear special space suits while traveling aboard the U.S. shuttle or Russian rockets. But once they’re safe inside the space station, crew members can wear regular clothing. Of course, a specially designed, pressurized space suit is required for space walks. It has to bear flying pieces and protect the astronauts from dramatic temperature changes. It can range from -84℃ in the shadow of the station to 121℃ in the hot sun. Personal Cleanliness         Simple tasks like brushing your teeth can be challenging in a weightless environment. A little water doesn’t flow in a stream. Astronauts will use a freshwater hose (软管) to take showers, shampoo, and wash off — then a second vacuum hose to suction (吸) off the dirty water. And how do you go to the bathroom in space? With a special “air toilet” that uses flowing air instead of water to get rid of waste.
