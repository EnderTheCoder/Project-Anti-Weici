A Light in the Darkness        We were moving to a new state after my husband had been out of work for many months and we had no money. In fact, we had to borrow money to reach our destination town. Anyway, it was my husband, 2 boys aged 4 and 2, and myself, 7 months pregnant (怀孕的), in an old Volvo station wagon (旅行车). We had been driving for 2 days in the middle of winter (the car’s heater didn’t work), and we had taken a route that was very desolate. There was nothing around for miles — no cars, buildings, or signs of civilization. Suddenly, our car started losing power and the gauges (仪表) went all out of order. We saw a light in the distance and managed to roll to a stop in front of this property that looked like a small simple house. Our cell phones had not gotten reception for many miles, and it was freezing outside, so I didn’t know if we were going to make it out of this situation alive. My husband got out of the car to see if there was something he could do to get us rolling again, but it was not looking good. A short while later, a man came out of the house and spoke with my husband a bit before inviting us all into his home.

The main idea of them is to never let the people know who their matches are until the last minute. These are some popular practices that are storming the world’s youth on this V-day.Speed dating        It’s exactly what the name implies. Complete with a timer, a whistle and 50 willing singles, speed dating is not the traditional dinner and a movie type of first date. Singles pay US $35 for three minutes with more than two dozen future dates. They ask questions and try to get to know each other. At the sound of a whistle, they do the same thing all over again ― 25 times in all.Lock and key party        Women are given a lock and men are given a key, upon arriving at the party. Each key and lock has several matches. One can hunt for his / her later-to-be sweetheart in various groups, and try out the key or lock. Each time a lock and key match the pair are entered into a ballot (票数) for top prizes!Dinner in the dark        Waiters wearing night vision glasses (夜视镜) guide the guests through the pitch-black dining room. They are seated at the table and familiarized with the wine glass and plate. Food is handled with the fingers. People will not see the food they are eating or the guests at their table until the dessert course. At that moment, dining partners will appear.Message party        Have A Cocktail, Leave A Message! When you arrive, you get a tag (标签) with a number and a pad of post-it notes. If you see someone you like, write a message on the message board. But wait … You’ve got a message … Go and collect it! You can make new friends and win lots of gifts. The more messages you leave on the bulletin board, the more chances you have of winning prizes.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p><span style=\"font-family:宋体\"></span></p><p style=\"white-space: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: 宋体; font-size: 14px;\">本文是一篇应用文，介绍了时下流行的四种结识新朋友的派对。</span></p><div><span style=\"font-family: 宋体;\"><br/></span></div><p><span style=\"font-family:宋体\"></span><br/></p><p><br/></p>","source":"第9周星期二","sub":"[{\"id\":9737,\"main_id\":58010,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"According to the text, what is the similarity of these parties?\",\"answer\":\"C.

Complete with a timer, a whistle and 50 willing singles, speed dating is not the traditional dinner and a movie type of first date.

At the sound of a whistle, they do the same thing all over again ― 25 times in all.</p><p><strong>Lock and key party</strong></p><p style=\"text-indent:28px\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Women are given a lock and men are given a key, upon arriving at the party. Each key and lock has several matches. One can hunt for his / her later-to-be sweetheart in various groups, and try out the key or lock. Each time a lock and key match the pair are entered into a ballot (<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">票数</span>) for top prizes!</p><p><strong>Dinner in the dark</strong></p><p style=\"text-indent:28px\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Waiters wearing night vision glasses (<span style=\"font-family: 宋体\">夜视镜</span>) guide the guests through the pitch-black dining room. They are seated at the table and familiarized with the wine glass and plate. Food is handled with the fingers. People will not see the food they are eating or the guests at their table until the dessert course. At that moment, dining partners will appear.</p><p><strong>Message party</strong></p><p style=\"text-indent:28px\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have A Cocktail, Leave A Message! When you arrive, you get a tag (<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">标签</span>) with a number and a pad of post-it notes. If you see someone you like, write a message on the message board. But wait … You’ve got a message … Go and collect it! You can make new friends and win lots of gifts.

       People have strong opinions about girls playing sports that historically have been played by boys, such as football, boxing, and wrestling. The feelings can be just as powerful when a boy wants to play on his school’s girls’ volleyball or field hockey team. Most of the people who are interested, no matter what their opinions are, tend to talk about fairness and opportunity. They all seem to want what is best for young people who love sports, but they do not always agree on what that means or how best to achieve it.        Until the 1970s, sports were often thought of as a boys’ activity, especially once children reached middle and high schools. In 1972, a new federal law was passed. The law had many parts, including a requirement that public schools and colleges offer equal sports programs for boys and girls. Because of this law, many schools began offering more sports for girls. Since 1972, many of those girls have grown up to play sports in college and even on professional teams. However, under the law, equal does not mean exactly the same. For example, a school may have a softball team for girls, but baseball for boys, or football only for boys and volleyball only for girls. But what if a girl wants to play on a boys’ sports team or a boy wants to try out for a sport that only has a girls’ team?        People who do not want girls on boys’ teams often say it could be dangerous. On average, girls tend to be shorter and weigh less than boys. Especially at the high school level and beyond, for contact sports like football, some parents and coaches think girls could be injured when playing with boys who outweigh them by 20, 40, or even 60 pounds. Others will reply that there is always a smallest, lightest boy on every team, too. They may say that girls who are willing to take the risk should be allowed to play.        Another worry about boys playing against girls is that the boys’ bigger size may give them an unfair advantage over girls.        Others think that girls may be nervous with boys on the team, even if the boys are not actually better players. Still, many people think boys as a group are louder and more aggressive when playing sports. They want girls to feel comfortable learning skills without worrying about boys’ behavior. But others may point out that some boys prefer to have a space that is for boys only, too. They explain that having a girl on the football team may cause the boys to feel or act differently. It could change traditions of those teams and the relationships of the players.        Having boys and girls excited about playing sports is a great thing — that is something everyone can agree on. However, it does leave schools, parents, and players with a tough question.

The feelings can be just as powerful when a boy wants to play on his school’s girls’ volleyball or field hockey team.

Because of this law, many schools began offering more sports for girls. Since 1972, many of those girls have grown up to play sports in college and even on professional teams. However, under the law, equal does not mean exactly the same. For example, a school may have a softball team for girls, but baseball for boys, or football only for boys and volleyball only for girls.

       Daylight Saving Time (DST), sometimes called summer time, was instituted (制定) to make better use of daylight. Clocks are set forward one hour in the spring to move an hour of daylight from the morning to the evening and then set back one hour in the fall to return to normal daylight.        Benjamin Franklin first came up with the idea of daylight saving. It is said that Franklin awoke early one morning and was surprised to see the sunlight at such an hour. Always the economist, Franklin believed the practice of moving the time could save on the use of candlelight, as candles were expensive at the time.        In England, builder William Willet became a strong supporter for Daylight Saving Time upon noticing blinds (百叶窗) of many houses were closed on an early sunny morning. Willet believed everyone, including himself, would appreciate longer hours of light in the evenings. In 1909, Sir Robert Pearce introduced a bill (法案) in the House of Commons to make it compulsory to adjust the clocks. A bill was drafted and introduced into Parliament several times but met with great opposition, mostly from farmers. Eventually, in 1925, it was decided that summer time should begin on the day following the third Saturday in April and close after the first Saturday in October.        The U.S. Congress passed the Standard Time Act of 1918 to establish standard time and preserve and set Daylight Saving Time across the continent. This act also devised five time zones throughout the United States: Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific, and Alaska. The first time zone was set on “the mean astronomical time of the seventy-fifth degree of longitude west from Greenwich (England)”. In 1919, this act was abolished.        President Roosevelt established year-round Daylight Saving Time (also called War Time) from 1942-1945. However, after this period, each state adopted its own DST, which proved to be confusing to television and radio broadcasting and transportation. In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson created the Department of Transportation and signed the Uniform Time Act. As a result, the Department of Transportation was given the responsibility for the time laws. During the oil embargo (禁运) and energy crisis of the 1970s, President Richard Nixon extended DST through the Daylight Saving Time Energy Act of 1973 to conserve energy further. This law was modified in 1986, and Daylight Saving Time was reset to begin on the first Sunday in April and end on the last Sunday in October.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 宋体;\">本文是一篇说明文。文章讲述了夏令时</span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\"> (Daylight Saving Time) </span><span style=\"font-family: 宋体;\">的由来及历次变更。</span></span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"第14周星期五","sub":"[{\"id\":9847,\"main_id\":58078,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"According to the text, Benjamin Franklin _______.\",\"answer\":\"B. first thought of the idea of daylight saving\",\"answer_a\":\"A. helped to establish standard time\",\"answer_b\":\"B. first thought of the idea of daylight saving\",\"answer_c\":\"C. called for people to reduce the use of candles\",\"answer_d\":\"D. put forward a bill to the House of Commons\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">事实细节题</span> <span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">文章第二段主要讲述了本杰明</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">·</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">富兰克林与夏令时的故事，是他首次提出了</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">“daytime saving”</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">这一想法。</span></p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":9848,\"main_id\":58078,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Who opposed the bill that was introduced in the House of Commons in the early 1900s?\",\"answer\":\"B.

       For many of us, the idea of devoting a whole evening a week to learning a language is a terrifying prospect (前景), as is opening a new set of books and CDs.        Babbel is a comprehensive learning system that allows the user to make learning part of his or her everyday life. Launched in 2007 in Berlin, it’s created and maintained (维护) by a team of 300 employees from 28 nations, including linguists, language teachers, native speakers, and authors.        The 14 language courses on offer are designed to be used on the go, anywhere and at any time, thanks to Babbel’s multi-platform mobile apps. These are free to download and contain 2,000–3,000 vocabulary words per language, pronounced by native speakers and accompanied by relevant images.         This native-speaker approach, says Markus Witte, CEO and founder of Babbel, is key to the company’s success. “The courses are designed by experienced language teachers and linguists,” he explains. “Their knowledge about learning processes and language pairings is extremely important when designing lessons. We offer 14 learning languages for seven mother tongues and it makes a huge difference whether a Portuguese or an English native learns Spanish.”        One of the real joys is being able to set your own pace and learn what you want and when you want to. Simply choose the language you want and start learning it right away with integrated speech recognition (综合的语音识别系统).        Registration with Babbel is completely free, as is one beginner and advanced lesson in every language, so you can start making progress immediately. If you choose to sign up you are offered monthly, three-monthly, six-monthly or yearly payment plans and this gives you immediate access to your chosen language on www.babbel.com as well as via the mobile apps for Android or iOS.        For many of us, the commitment of an evening’s work is the last thing we want after a full day. So if you don’t have the hours to put in, Babbel lets you save your completed lessons in the Cloud so you can pick up where you left off. You are also allowed to repeat a course or lesson as many times as you like and, if you miss the pleasure of formal education, you can even get a certificate for every course you complete. Babbel’s real goal, says Witte, is to have its learners ready for using their new language in real life after just a few lessons.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 宋体;\">本文是一篇说明文。文章介绍了</span>Babbel<span style=\"font-family: 宋体;\">这个外语学习系统的特点及使用方法。</span></span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"第16周星期五","sub":"[{\"id\":9872,\"main_id\":58082,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Babbel's apps _______.\",\"answer\":\"C. have vocabulary words with related pictures\",\"answer_a\":\"A. offer free essential lessons\",\"answer_b\":\"B. provide seven language courses\",\"answer_c\":\"C. have vocabulary words with related pictures\",\"answer_d\":\"D. contain vocabulary words pronounced by experienced teachers\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">事实细节题</span> <span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">根据第三段的最后一句</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Calibri&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;\\\">These are free to download and contain 2,000</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">–</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Calibri&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;\\\">3,000 vocabulary words per language, pronounced by native speakers and accompanied by relevant images.</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">可知，</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Calibri&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;\\\">Babbel</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">的词配有图片或影像说明。</span></p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":9873,\"main_id\":58082,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"We can learn from the text that Babbel users can _______.\",\"answer\":\"B. control the process of learning themselves\",\"answer_a\":\"A. get certificates of formal education\",\"answer_b\":\"B. control the process of learning themselves\",\"answer_c\":\"C. take courses developed by native speakers\",\"answer_d\":\"D. communicate with experienced teachers online\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">推理判断题</span> <span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">阅读全文可知，</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Calibri&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;\\\">Babbel</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">简单易用，使用者可以根据自己的时间安排学习，自己控制学习进度或重复学习，还可获得课程证书，由此可知</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Calibri&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;\\\">Babbel</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">的使用者可以自己控制学习过程。</span></p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":9874,\"main_id\":58082,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"We can infer from Paragraph 4 that _______.\",\"answer\":\"A. language learning differs widely between native and non-native speakers\",\"answer_a\":\"A. language learning differs widely between native and non-native speakers\",\"answer_b\":\"B. experienced language teachers have similar learning approaches\",\"answer_c\":\"C. language learning has a great effect on the development of native languages\",\"answer_d\":\"D. different languages require different learning processes\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">推理判断题</span> <span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">结合第四段的最后两句</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Calibri&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;\\\">Their knowledge about learning processes and language pairings is extremely important when designing lessons.

But the space station has been designed to keep the astronauts as comfortable as possible — the modules (舱) are roomy, bright, and kept at a constant 21℃. It’s important the crew members are comfortable because they’ll be busy aboard the station. In a typical workday, crew members will spend 14 hours working and exercising, 1.5 hours preparing and eating meals, and 8.5 hours sleeping. Here are some other fun facts about life aboard the station:Food        Come mealtime, astronauts will have a special dining kitchen. Space food just keeps getting better — and more like food we enjoy here on Earth. In early space missions (任务), astronauts could eat only freeze-dried food that didn’t require any preparation. But the space station is equipped with water, microwave ovens, and refrigerators, allowing the folks on board to eat more “normal” types of food, including fruit, vegetables, and ice cream!Sleep        Each crew member has a private room. With no gravity, they’ll need to tie themselves to their beds, or they will float away! That might sound like a strange way to sleep, but astronauts from past space missions report that sleeping in space is actually pretty great!Exercise        You might not think it, but exercise is even more important on the station than it is on Earth. There is not much gravity in space. Astronauts don’t stand up, sit down or walk in space, so their muscles and bones don’t have to work much — and this muscle and bone loss can be dangerous back on Earth. To fight this, astronauts on the station will exercise on bikes, rowing machines, and other equipment about two hours every day.Clothing        Astronauts will have to wear special space suits while traveling aboard the U.S. shuttle or Russian rockets. But once they’re safe inside the space station, crew members can wear regular clothing. Of course, a specially designed, pressurized space suit is required for space walks. It has to bear flying pieces and protect the astronauts from dramatic temperature changes. It can range from -84℃ in the shadow of the station to 121℃ in the hot sun. Personal Cleanliness         Simple tasks like brushing your teeth can be challenging in a weightless environment. A little water doesn’t flow in a stream. Astronauts will use a freshwater hose (软管) to take showers, shampoo, and wash off — then a second vacuum hose to suction (吸) off the dirty water. And how do you go to the bathroom in space? With a special “air toilet” that uses flowing air instead of water to get rid of waste.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p><span style=\"font-family: 宋体; font-size: 14px;\">本文是一篇说明文，介绍了宇航员的太空生活。</span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"第17周星期五","sub":"[{\"id\":9896,\"main_id\":58084,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"The text is mainly about _______.\",\"answer\":\"B. fun facts about life in space\",\"answer_a\":\"A. ways to get used to life in space\",\"answer_b\":\"B. fun facts about life in space\",\"answer_c\":\"C. temperature changes in space\",\"answer_d\":\"D. a typical workday in space\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">主旨大意题</span> <span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">根据第一段最后一句可知答案。</span></p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":9897,\"main_id\":58084,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What can we learn about space food from the text?\",\"answer\":\"D.
