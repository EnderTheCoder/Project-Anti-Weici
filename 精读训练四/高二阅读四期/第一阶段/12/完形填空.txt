题目:        As I look back on it now, I realize it was kind of silly of me to be so worried when Daddy was really just late. I ### every night for Daddy whom I ### around everywhere.
        That day, I stood at my ### place by the door, awaiting his ### from work. 
        After standing there for a while, I began to ### where Daddy was. I ran into the kitchen and asked Mummy ### , “When is Daddy coming?”
      “### , honey,” Mummy replied distractedly (心不在焉地) ### she was following a recipe for dinner.
        I ran back to the ### , for I knew that Daddy was coming and that I wasn’t standing there for nothing. I began to recite (背诵) the words.
        Tired of that, I went back to the ### to ask Mummy again but before I could open my ### , she handed me a My Little Pony colouring book. She said, “I’m ### , Daniel. Go and ### a pretty picture and I’ll hang it on the refrigerator.”
        I went back, put my book and crayons (蜡笔) down, then went to get my mini-rocking chair to sit in. After a while, the ### became a pink-and-purple artistic wonder.
        Soon I smiled with ### as I heard the sound of the garage door ### and Daddy’s driving in. I heard him open and close his car door. The ### thing I knew was that the door opened and ### stood Daddy. I stood up and held my arms out. I ### him and whispered, “I love you.”
        As I sit at the computer finishing this story, I know Daddy will be home soon. I still ### when he’s late. I still go to greet him when he arrives.
