Eventually, I heard some good things about them and I picked up the first book of the series and discovered that, although the book still had a cute dinosaur cover, the material inside the cover was well worth reading.        At the start of the book, Peter Hobson, a medical student, attends an organ-harvesting on a motorcycle victim. After that, he begins to wonder where the line between life and death actually is. After graduation, Hobson pursues (从事) research into the development of a super-sensitive egg to determine the actual instant of death. During his research, Hobson and his good friend Sarkar Muhammed develop a technique for creating a perfect neural scan (神经系统的扫描) of a person’s brain.        Hobson and Muhammed create three copies of Peter Hobson inside computers at Muhammed’s lab. One “Hobson” is immortal (不朽的), one “Hobson” is dead and one “Hobson” is the control.        While this is going on, Hobson’s personal life is falling apart. His wife falls in love with a co-worker and Hobson’s father-in-law dies because of a medicinal reaction. To make matters worse, a police investigation focuses on Hobson’s life and work.        Sawyer is writing a mystery in this book, and, to a certain extent, succeeds. The pace is good, keeping you turning the pages. However, because of the way Sawyer creates his mystery, there is no real chance of figuring out who is responsible. This book uses the way that Conan Doyle would always have Holmes solve the crime by pointing out a piece of evidence that was known only to Holmes and not to Watson. Nevertheless, just as the Holmes stories are wellworth reading, I would also have no hesitation to recommend The Terminal Experiment to a friend.        Oh, yeah. Go out and get Sawyer’s other books, too. At the very least, you’ll be entertained. More likely, you’ll begin to think about our society.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p>本文是一篇记叙文。作者五岁时因为生气将自家的纱门踢出了一个裂口，作者的父母并没有因此责备他，也没有修补裂口。这让作者觉得比受责备还要难受，作者也从这件事中领悟到了很多道理。</p><p>句子点拨<br/></p><p>①My parents taught me a valuable lesson, one that a spanking or stern words perhaps could not deliver. 句意为：父母给我上了宝贵的一课，那是打屁股或严厉斥责都无法给予的。teach sb a lesson意思是“给某人一个教训”；that引导定语从句修饰先行词one。one作lesson的同位语。</p>","source":"第6周星期二","sub":"[{\"id\":9623,\"main_id\":57973,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"The purpose of this text is to _________.\",\"answer\":\"A. introduce the story of The Terminal Experiment\",\"answer_a\":\"A. introduce the story of The Terminal Experiment\",\"answer_b\":\"B. show different opinions on The Terminal Experiment\",\"answer_c\":\"C. analyse Robert Sawyer’s writing skills\",\"answer_d\":\"D. compare The Terminal Experiment with Holmes\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">写作目的题</span> <span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">全文对</span><span style=\\\"font-size: 14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,serif\\\">Robert Sawyer</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">的作品</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,serif\\\">The Terminal Experiment</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">的内容作了简单介绍，并进行了评论，故</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,serif\\\">A</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">项符合要求。</span></p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":9624,\"main_id\":57973,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"The highlighted word “them” in the first paragraph refers to _________.\",\"answer\":\"C.

Eventually, I heard some good things about them and I picked up the first book of the series and discovered that, although the book still had a cute dinosaur cover, the material inside the cover was well worth reading.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the start of the book, Peter Hobson, a medical student, attends an organ-harvesting on a motorcycle victim. After that, he begins to wonder where the line between life and death actually is. After graduation, Hobson pursues (从事) research into the development of a super-sensitive egg to determine the actual instant of death. During his research, Hobson and his good friend Sarkar Muhammed develop a technique for creating a perfect neural scan (神经系统的扫描) of a person’s brain.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hobson and Muhammed create three copies of Peter Hobson inside computers at Muhammed’s lab. One “Hobson” is immortal (不朽的), one “Hobson” is dead and one “Hobson” is the control.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While this is going on, Hobson’s personal life is falling apart. His wife falls in love with a co-worker and Hobson’s father-in-law dies because of a medicinal reaction. To make matters worse, a police investigation focuses on Hobson’s life and work.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sawyer is writing a mystery in this book, and, to a certain extent, succeeds. The pace is good, keeping you turning the pages. However, because of the way Sawyer creates his mystery, there is no real chance of figuring out who is responsible. This book uses the way that Conan Doyle would always have Holmes solve the crime by pointing out a piece of evidence that was known only to Holmes and not to Watson. Nevertheless, just as the Holmes stories are well</p><p>worth reading, I would also have no hesitation to recommend The Terminal Experiment to a friend.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, yeah. Go out and get Sawyer’s other books, too. At the very least, you’ll be entertained.

Everyone has the right to live the way they want to live. However, should we fight to protect every traditional practice? Are all tradition practices good? No culture is perfect. Every culture has some practices that are unfair.        For example, in traditional Indian culture there is something called the caste (社会等级) system. A caste is a person’s social level. If a person in India is born in a rich family, then he or she is in a high caste. That person will have a comfortable life and a good education. If a person is born in a lower caste, that person will have a very difficult life and no education. In some parts of India, it’s impossible to leave your caste. If you are born in low caste, you will stay there for the rest of your life, no matter how hard you work. There is even a group called the untouchables. These people are the lowest caste. People think they’re so dirty that nobody should touch them. This is part of traditional heritage. Should we protect it?        In the USA, women didn’t get the right to vote until the year 1919. Many men didn’t want women to vote. They said that in traditional American culture, only men should control the country.        It is important to protect traditional culture, but it’s also important for every culture to grow and improve. Most traditional practices should be protected, but some should not.

If a person is born in a lower caste, that person will have a very difficult life and no education. In some parts of India, it’s impossible to leave your caste. If you are born in low caste, you will stay there for the rest of your life, no matter how hard you work. There is even a group called the untouchables. These people are the lowest caste.

Some sort of propaganda (宣传) influenced you to make that decision. That thing has a name and it’s called persuasion, a process which aims to change one’s attitude, behavior, beliefs, intention and principles. Persuasion is a very powerful weapon that can be used wisely in all types of businesses, presentations and public speeches. So it’s necessary to master the art of persuasion.        There are many benefits of mastering the art of persuasion. Firstly, it can help you convince and encourage people of your class. By mastering the art of persuasion, you can change a person’s attitude towards something. We often convince our parents to spend some money and buy us cars, cinema tickets and beautiful clothes. You steer (驾驭) all these actions by using effectively the art of persuasion. Most of us don’t even realize that our lives are getting influenced by persuasion.        Secondly, it can help you succeed in a job interview. When you apply for a job, you know there are thousands of applicants for the same job you’re eager to get. The only way to stand out from thousands of interviewees for that particular job is by applying persuasion to nail that job. You sell yourself to him, convince your interviewer that he won’t find somebody like you elsewhere and he’ll look to you in a brighter way than the others.        Thirdly, it can help you succeed in your business. The business world today is getting larger and more competitive and it doesn’t fit everyone. Only the ones who can master the art of persuasion are able to succeed. Persuasion in business can be applied through several ways, such as propaganda and advertising. Therefore, you should realize that persuasion is quite helpful in selling more products or services and can help you succeed in all types of businesses.        Lastly, it can help you avoid being persuaded by other people. Can you recall the product that you bought in a shop that seemed to be very useful and cost-effective at first glance and made you change your view upon it, but after a while you realized that you wasted your money for something worthless? I know you remember it. And that was a successful attempt of persuasion. You could have prevented that purchase if you mastered the art of persuasion by making the right decision with a reasonable response.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p>本文是一篇议论文。掌握劝说艺术是必要的，文章从四个方面说明了掌握劝说艺术的好处。</p><p><span style=\";font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">句子点拨</span></span></p><p><span style=\";font-family:宋体;font-size:14px\">①</span><span style=\";font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;font-size:14px\">Can you recall the product that you bought in a shop that seemed to be very useful and cost-effective at first glance</span><span style=\";font-family:宋体;font-size:14px\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\";font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;font-size:14px\">and made you change your view upon it, but after a while you realized that you wasted your money for something</span><span style=\";font-family:宋体;font-size:14px\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\";font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;font-size:14px\">worthless? <span style=\"font-family:宋体\">句意为：你还记得在商店里买过这样的产品吗？乍看上去很实用又划算，并使你改变了对它的看法，但不久你就意识到钱花得不值。</span></span></p>","source":"第15周星期四","sub":"[{\"id\":9844,\"main_id\":58067,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What is the text mainly about?\",\"answer\":\"B.

It’s a style of music he did much to define in Star Wars and then for many other films for the director Steven Spielberg. There are distinctive melodies which give the feeling of flying, parts of music to represent different characters and complex details. In addition, everything follows the symphonic style of a hundred years ago. It’s what the film industry in Hollywood wants, and what audiences everywhere expect.        Can we call it art, or is it simply a sort of factory product? For the cinema-goer sitting with a popcorn bag the question doesn’t arise. But since film music now spreads to a different audience far outside cinemas, on promoted soundtrack CDs and serious concert platforms, it may be interesting to answer the question.         Composers themselves have expressed very diverse opinions. Interviewed some years ago, Williams himself proudly referred to film music as “the opera of the 20th century”. On the other hand, Richard Rodney Bennett, the composer of the music for the film Murder on the Orient Express, declared that “in writing film music one is really using only a sixth of one’s musical mind”. Everyone agrees on one point though: the rewards are pleasingly high. There are royalties (版税). And if you hit the right buttons you can get into the sideline (副业) of a concert career, regularly mounting (举办) live performances of film compositions.        But if you consider the working conditions that composers put up with, it may be hard to class film music as art. First of all, film music is composed in snippets (片段), timed to the second, and written after the film is shot. Then there are mad deadlines. Next, the composer has to live with the fact that he has no artistic control. Finally, the worst thing is that what is written struggles to get itself noticed against a background of dialogue and every possible visual delight from cartoon character Shrek’s green body to actor Tom Cruise’s chin.        But think of the German composer Bach in the eighteenth century, satisfying his employers by writing one cantata (清唱剧) a week. Few composers can write without a task. And for the true artist, rules and restrictions stimulate (激发热情).        So, what’s my conclusion? Art or factory product? Both in fact, although there’s rather more of the factory product than I would like at times.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\">本文是一篇议论文。电影音乐到底是不是艺术？作者阐述了不同音乐家及自己的观点。</span></p>","source":"第20周星期二","sub":"[{\"id\":10465,\"main_id\":58395,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What is the author trying to say about John Williams’ music?\",\"answer\":\"A.

It’s a style of music he did much to define in Star Wars and then for many other films for the director Steven Spielberg. There are distinctive melodies which give the feeling of flying, parts of music to represent different characters and complex details. In addition, everything follows the symphonic style of a hundred years ago. It’s what the film industry in Hollywood wants, and what audiences everywhere expect.</p><p style=\"text-indent:28px\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can we call it art, or is it simply a sort of factory product? For the cinema-goer sitting with a popcorn bag the question doesn’t arise. But since film music now spreads to a different audience far outside cinemas, on promoted soundtrack CDs and serious concert platforms, it may be interesting to answer the question.</p><p style=\"text-indent:28px\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Composers themselves have expressed very diverse opinions. Interviewed some years ago, Williams himself proudly referred to film music as “the opera of the 20th century”. On the other hand, Richard Rodney Bennett, the composer of the music for the film Murder on the Orient Express, declared that “in writing film music one is really using only a sixth of one’s musical mind”. Everyone agrees on one point though: the rewards are pleasingly high. There are royalties (<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">版税</span>). And if you hit the right buttons you can get into the sideline (<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">副业</span>) of a concert career, regularly mounting (<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">举办</span>) live performances of film compositions.</p><p style=\"text-indent:28px\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But if you consider the working conditions that composers put up with, it may be hard to class film music as art. First of all, film music is composed in snippets (<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">片段</span>), timed to the second, and written after the film is shot. Then there are mad deadlines. Next, the composer has to live with the fact that he has no artistic control. Finally, the worst thing is that what is written struggles to get itself noticed against a background of dialogue and every possible visual delight from cartoon character Shrek’s green body to actor Tom Cruise’s chin.</p><p style=\"text-indent:28px\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But think of the German composer Bach in the eighteenth century, satisfying his employers by writing one cantata (<span style=\"font-family: 宋体\">清唱剧</span>) a week. Few composers can write without a task. And for the true artist, rules and restrictions stimulate (<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">激发热情</span>).</p><p style=\"text-indent:28px\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, what’s my conclusion? Art or factory product? Both in fact, although there’s rather more of the factory product than I would like at times.</p>"},{"id":58426,"word_id":0,"test_group":4,"check_point":4,"questions":0,"subject":"        As I look back on it now, I realize it was kind of silly of me to be so worried when Daddy was really just late.

       Many people say William Shakespeare’s writing is old, boring and difficult to read. However, that is simply not true. Even though Shakespeare wrote during the 1500s and 1600s, his themes are still relevant (切题的) today, and his writing is actually easy to understand if you take the time to break it down.        Shakespeare wrote many plays and poems that had excitement, suspense (悬念), comedy, romance, and human drama. For example, Shakespeare wrote about teenagers hanging out with their friends, fairies playing tricks on humans, ghosts haunting (出没于) castles, suspenseful sword fights, and lovers dying in each other’s arms. Shakespeare’s writing also shows that people faced the same challenges and emotions in the Renaissance (文艺复兴) as they do today. For example, he wrote about a young man who had to prove to his father that he was responsible.        Shakespeare’s language is not too difficult to figure out if you have patience and focus on the words as metaphors (隐喻). For example, think about this quote: “Let every eye negotiate for itself.” You know what all of those words mean individually, but you may not understand what they mean together. That is because he sometimes used words in a nonliteral (非直接的) way. Basically, Shakespeare is saying “Let each person decide for himself or herself.” He is saying that everyone should be able to make his or her own choices or judgments. This message is as relevant today as it was when it was written long ago. Whether you like comedy or tragedy, action or romance, you may find that you can relate to Shakespeare’s stories more than you think.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p><span style=\"font-family:宋体\">本文是一篇议论文。许多人认为莎士比亚的作品内容陈旧、枯燥，难于理解。但是作者认为莎士比亚的作品主题与当代社会联系紧密。如果读者能够花时间把它分成多个部分研读，内容也易于理解。</span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"第2周星期二","sub":"[{\"id\":10545,\"main_id\":58436,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"The author provides evidence to show that William Shakespeare wrote _______.\",\"answer\":\"B. about themes that are of great value today\",\"answer_a\":\"A. about the dangers in the 1500s and 1600s\",\"answer_b\":\"B. about themes that are of great value today\",\"answer_c\":\"C. essays with very old vocabularies\",\"answer_d\":\"D. essays with political messages\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">推理判断题</span> <span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">阅读第一段可知，作者提出观点：莎士比亚的作品主题与当代社会仍有密切联系。在第二段，作者举例证明这一紧密联系。所以选项</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;\\\">B</span><span style=\\\"font-size:14px;font-family:宋体\\\">为正确答案。</span></p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":10546,\"main_id\":58436,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Which evidence best supports the idea that Shakespeare wrote about emotions?\",\"answer\":\"A.

However, that is simply not true. Even though Shakespeare wrote during the 1500s and 1600s, his themes are still relevant (<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">切题的</span>) today, and his writing is actually easy to understand if you take the time to break it down.</p><p style=\"text-indent:28px\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shakespeare wrote many plays and poems that had excitement, suspense (<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">悬念</span>), comedy, romance, and human drama. For example, Shakespeare wrote about teenagers hanging out with their friends, fairies playing tricks on humans, ghosts haunting (<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">出没于</span>) castles, suspenseful sword fights, and lovers dying in each other<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">’</span>s arms. Shakespeare<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">’</span>s writing also shows that people faced the same challenges and emotions in the Renaissance (<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">文艺复兴</span>) as they do today. For example, he wrote about a young man who had to prove to his father that he was responsible.</p><p style=\"text-indent:28px\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shakespeare’s language is not too difficult to figure out if you have patience and focus on the words as metaphors (<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">隐喻</span>). For example, think about this quote: “Let every eye negotiate for itself.” You know what all of those words mean individually, but you may not understand what they mean together. That is because he sometimes used words in a nonliteral (<span style=\"font-family:宋体\">非直接的</span>) way. Basically, Shakespeare is saying “Let each person decide for himself or herself.” He is saying that everyone should be able to make his or her own choices or judgments. This message is as relevant today as it was when it was written long ago. Whether you like comedy or tragedy, action or romance, you may find that you can relate to Shakespeare’s stories more than you think.</p>"},{"id":58448,"word_id":0,"test_group":3,"check_point":3,"questions":0,"subject":"        It was almost the worst birthday of Abraham Lincoln’s life.        On February 11, 1861 (the day before he turned fifty-two), Lincoln left for Washington to become the nation’s sixteenth President. As he left home in Springfield, Illinois, Lincoln handed his son Robert a black oilskin (油布) bag, and told him to keep it carefully. He did not tell Robert what was inside.        Unknown to his seventeen-year-old son, Lincoln had placed his newly written inaugural speech in the bag. It was to be the most important speech he ever made. And it was his only copy.        When the train arrived in Indianapolis — the first stop on the long journey — Lincoln rode off in a special car without his family. Robert walked from the station to the local hotel.        When Robert arrived at the hotel, he learned that his family’s rooms were not ready. So he asked that the bag should be held at the front desk. Then he went off to be with friends.        On his return, Robert found his father waiting anxiously. Where was the bag? Robert explained that he had checked it at the desk.        An angry Lincoln sped to the hall and leaped over the front desk. He began searching through a huge pile of luggage.        As puzzled guests looked on, Lincoln dragged from the pile a familiar-looking black bag and opened it, only to find someone else’s dirty clothes. It was the wrong bag. Back he went to the pile.        At last he found the valuable bag and the speech inside. Lincoln handed it to his son and said strictly, “Now you keep it!”        It was the one and only time, Robert said, that his father had ever lost his temper at him.
