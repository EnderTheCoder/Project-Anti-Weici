       Katie sat on the green bench in the playground and stared at all the children playing together and having fun. It was her third day at school and still no one had spoken to her at playtime. She knew she should go and ask a group of children if she could join in their game, but something was stopping her.        “Oh look, it’s that girl who talks funny,” said a loud voice from across the playground. She looked across to see a small girl with her hair in plaits (发辫) and a bright, unpleasant smile on her face.        “Do you want to come and play with us?” said the girl with plaits, imitating (模仿) Katie’s Irish accent. Katie looked away. Maybe if she just ignored the girl, she would go away.        “Leave her alone, Miranda,” said another girl with curly, blonde hair. “It’s not easy when you’re new.”        “Yeah, you’d know all about not having any friends, wouldn’t you?” Miranda said angrily. Bored, Miranda moved away to carry on her skipping game with her friends.        The girl with blonde hair walked over to Katie.        “Do you want to play hopscotch (跳房子)?” she asked her in a quiet voice.        Katie shrugged (耸肩). “OK,” she said, and smiled, relieved that finally someone was asking her to play.        They played hopscotch for a while. Katie found out the blonde girl’s name was Holly and that she was new as well.        “Where do you come from?” said Holly.        “My family and I just moved from Ireland. It’s not that far away,” said Katie, thinking about how different things were here. In Ireland she had walked down quiet country roads to get to school, listening to the birds singing.  She especially loved the smell of the fields after a heavy downpour. She also missed her friends and thought about how happy she had been going into school every day, knowing that there were people there who made her feel safe. Thinking about it now made her eyes water a little. Here, she and her mum had a horrible walk across a busy main road to get into school, breathing in smoke from lorries, being deafened by the sound of too fast motorbikes.         “Where did you live before?” asked Katie.        “Still in London. Just down the road. I had to move to this school because my sister’s here. Mum wanted us both at the same place.” She moved her face closer to Katie and smiled. “Cheer up! You won’t always be new, you know.”Katie smiled weakly.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p>本文是一篇记叙文。文章主要讲了小女孩Katie来到新学校但还没有完全适应，同样是新来的小女孩Holly给了她慰藉和鼓励。</p>","source":"第6周星期四","sub":"[{\"id\":9614,\"main_id\":57958,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What do we know about Katie in the first paragraph?\\n\\n\\t \\t \",\"answer\":\"C.

Harvest Festival is a celebration of the food grown on the land. In England, we have given thanks for successful harvests since pagan times (异教徒时代).  We celebrate this day by singing, praying and decorating our churches with baskets of fruit and food in a festival known as “Harvest Festival”, usually during the month of September.        Harvest Festival reminds Christians of all the good things God gives them. This makes them want to share with others who are not so fortunate. In schools and in churches, people bring food from home to a Harvest Festival Service.  After the service, the food that has been put on display is usually made into parcels and given to people in need.         When Is Harvest Festival?        Harvest festivals are traditionally held on or near the Sunday of the Harvest Moon. This is the full moon which falls in September, about Sept. 23. Unlike the USA and Canada, the UK does not have a national holiday for Harvest Festival.         History of Harvest Festival — Traditions and Customs        Harvest Festival used to be celebrated at the beginning of the Harvest season on 1 August and was called Lammas, meaning “loaf Mass”. Farmers made loaves of bread from the new wheat crop and gave them to their local church. They were then used as the Communion bread during a special mass thanking God for the harvest. The custom ended when Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church, and nowadays we have harvest festivals at the end of the season.         Farmers celebrated the end of the harvest with a big meal called harvest supper. This was rather like a Christmas dinner, but as turkeys were unknown at that time, a goose stuffed (填充) with apples was eaten. Goose Fairs are still held in some English towns, but geese are no longer sold.

       Eating nuts and peanuts reduces the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke, a new study says. Researchers found they were linked with (有联系) a reduced risk of death from heart disease among people on low incomes. And they believe their findings suggest peanuts may be a cost-effective measure to improve cardiovascular (心血管) health because they are so cheap.        However, experts cautioned today that salt-covered nuts would not have the same health benefits. Nuts are rich innutrients (营养) and peanuts, although classified as one bean, have nutrients similar to tree nuts.        The new study, led by Dr Xiao-Ou Shu, of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Tennessee, analysed various groups of people. One involved 72,000 low-income black and white men and women living in the US, the other 134,000 men and women living in Shanghai, China. In both groups, men ate more peanuts than women. In the US group, about half of the nuts consumed (吃) were peanuts, and in the Chinese group only peanut consumption was considered.        The researchers found that overall, eating nuts reduced the risk of death from heart disease. In the US, the highest consumption resulted in a risk reduction of 21 per cent. In the Chinese group, it was 17 per cent.        Dr Shu said: “We observed no clear connections between nut or peanut consumption and risk of death due to cancer and diabetes.” She added the findings highlight (强调) the large public health influence of nut or peanut consumption in lowering deaths from heart disease — especially for their affordability.        The research was published in JAMA Internal Medicine.        Dr Mitchell Katz, deputy editor of the journal, added: “Of course, peanuts are not really nuts.

Here are directions for making your own mask:What You Will Need:● A clean, one-gallon plastic milk jug (壶)● Paper towels or a brown paper bag● White glue● Sandpaper● Paint● Yarn (纱线), if desiredWhat to Do:Step 1 With an adult’s help, cut off the spout (壶口) of a clean, one-gallon plastic milk jug. Cut the jug in half from the top to the bottom so that the handle (柄) is in the middle of one of the halves. The half with the handle will be the mask; the handle itself will be the nose.Step 2 With an adult’s help, cut holes for the eyes and a hole for the mouth. Use sandpaper to smooth all rough edges of the mask.Step 3 Cover your work area. Tear paper towels or a brown paper bag into one-inch squares. Put them in a bowl containing a half-and-half mixture of white glue and water for a few minutes. Press firmly the extra glue from the pieces, one at a time, and place them on the mask. Cover the entire front of the mask and all of the edges. Let the mask dry completely. (It may take a day or two.)Step 4 Paint the mask and let it dry.After You Have Finished:        You can hang the mask on a wall as a decoration or make holes in the sides (with an adult’s help), tie a piece of yarn to each hole, and wear the mask as part of a costume for a made-up drama.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p><span style=\"font-size:13px;font-family:方正书宋简体\">本文是一篇应用文，介绍了如何制作化装舞会的面具。</span></p><p><br/></p>","source":"第8周星期四","sub":"[{\"id\":10097,\"main_id\":58198,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What should you ask an adult to help you to do in the making process?\",\"answer\":\"B.

       American folk music is the music of the people. “Good Night Irene,” is an example of a traditional folk song. That means the song is so old, no one really knows who wrote it. Huddie Ledbetter, the singer and guitarist known as Ledbelly, first recorded “Good Night Irene” in 1932. Since then more than a hundred other versions have been recorded. “Good Night Irene,” was a huge hit for the Weavers in 1950.        Folk songs sometimes tell stories about real events. An example is the story of a young man whose last name was spelled D-U-L-A but pronounced “Dooley”. Tom Dula was a Civil War soldier in North Carolina. He was found guilty of the murder of his girlfriend. He was hanged in 1868, yet the case left many questions. The story was retold in poems and songs — including the hit song, “Tom Dooley,” recorded in 1958 by the Kingston Trio.        Folk singer and songwriter Amy Speace says the history of American folk music can be imagined as a tree with many branches. At the center, she says, is Woody Guthrie. Woody Guthrie wrote almost 3,000 songs. But he only recorded about 300 of them. His granddaughter Anna Canoni says that was partly because he did not have enough money to record more.        Yet for all his influence, millions of Americans today remember him for just one song, which children learned in school. The song, “This Land Is Your Land,” seems like the perfect expression of pride in country. What many people do not know is that it was meant sarcastically (讽刺地), as just the opposite. This meaning is made clear later in the song, in the parts that most children never learn in school.         Some people probably think of a folk singer out of date from the 1960s. A long-haired, guitar-playing idealist who sings about bringing the world together. But these days, with music production software, digital video and social networks all easily available, folk artists really can bring the world together.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p><span style=\"font-size:13px;font-family:方正书宋简体\">本文是一篇说明文，主要介绍了美国民间音乐，包括与其有关的乐队、歌手、歌曲等。</span></p>","source":"第20周星期四","sub":"[{\"id\":10283,\"main_id\":58302,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What do we know about “Good Night Irene”?\",\"answer\":\"B.
