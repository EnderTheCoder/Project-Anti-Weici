The eight-minute video that he recorded became an Internet hit and has been viewed by millions of people all over the world.\n        The video begins with a group of Cape buffalo (水牛) nearing a watering hole. Nearby, a group of lions wait, hiding from their prey. As soon as the lead buffalo spots the lions, it turns, and the chase (追赶) is on. The lions separate a small Cape buffalo calf from its mother and knock it into the water. The lions surround the calf and work slowly to pull it back out of the water. Before they are successful, however, a hungry crocodile comes by and takes hold of the calf’s back leg with its powerful jaws. Now the lions are trying to fight off the crocodile!\n        It may sound like the poor calf was sure to die, but what happens next is the reason this video became popular and has had over 64 million hits since it was posted in 2007.\n        As the lions and the crocodile are fighting over the calf, the other Cape buffaloes regroup and charge the lions! One buffalo throws a lion into the air with its large horns, and the others move with heavy steps and snort (哼) at the frightened lions. The calf, though injured, manages to stand up and return to its mother in the group. The angry Cape buffaloes then chase the lions away from the watering hole.\n        The video of “The Battle at Kruger” is a powerful example of why you should never give up hope, even in the face of a seemingly hopeless situation.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p>本文是一篇记叙文。一位游客拍摄的一段视频在网上热传。视频中，一头非洲小水牛被狮群包围，然后又被一 只饥饿的鳄鱼咬住了后腿，然而就在小水牛命悬一线的时刻，情况发生了逆转。小水牛的妈妈和一群水牛冲过去围 攻狮群，最终小水牛获救。作者通过这个故事说明了一个道理：即使身处逆境也不要轻易放弃希望。</p>","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":7254,\"main_id\":52296,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What is the author’s main purpose in writing the text?\",\"answer\":\"D.

Gross’s big idea was small coins. She knew that pennies often seem like worthless things. But she thought that if she and other students could gather enough of them, the money could really make a difference. This was the beginning of the Penny Harvest. Today, more than half a million students take part in the program. In its first 20 years, the Penny Harvest has collected $8.1 million in pennies!        Gross and her father founded Common Cents, a not-for-profit (非盈利的) organization, to manage their money collecting efforts. They believe the penny drives can help develop young people’s generosity and moral (道德的) character. After the pennies are collected, students form philanthropy roundtables to discuss community problems and to decide where to donate (捐) the collected money. Many students become inspired by the process and go on to become volunteers at the organizations they support, which include animal care facilities, community gardens, senior centers, and homeless shelters.        Teddy Gross explains: “We at Common Cents regard America’s billion-dollar resource (资源) of pennies — found in large quantities in the homes of both the rich and poor — as the philanthropic belongings of young people.

She knew that pennies often seem like worthless things. But she thought that if she and other students could gather enough of them, the money could really make a difference. This was the beginning of the Penny Harvest. Today, more than half a million students take part in the program. In its first 20 years, the Penny Harvest has collected $8.1 million in pennies!</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gross and her father founded Common Cents, a not-for-profit (非盈利的) organization, to manage their money collecting efforts. They believe the penny drives can help develop young people’s generosity and moral (道德的) character. After the pennies are collected, students form philanthropy roundtables to discuss community problems&nbsp;and to decide where to donate (捐) the collected money. Many students become inspired by the process and go on to become volunteers at the organizations they support, which include animal care facilities, community gardens, senior centers, and homeless shelters.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Teddy Gross explains: “We at Common Cents regard America’s billion-dollar resource (资源) of pennies — found in large quantities in the homes of both the rich and poor — as the philanthropic belongings of young people. For this reason, every penny the children collect is theirs to give away in an educational group process.” The students devoted to the Penny Harvest have changed the world for the better, and they have learned valuable lessons about caring for others in their communities.</p>"},{"id":52302,"word_id":0,"test_group":3,"check_point":3,"questions":0,"subject":"Kids’ Fleet Summer Day Camp\n       Summer camp is a lot of fun when you’re a Kids’ Fleet Camper!

And of course, Prague has its own culture as well.       During World War II, many European cities were heavily bombed. However, Prague suffered very little damage during the war. As a result, all of its ancient buildings remain undamaged.       Old Town Square is the number one stop for tourists visiting Prague. The square is more than 800 years old; if you go there, remember that some amazing things have happened there in the past. For example, on the ground you can see 27 crosses. That’s because 400 years ago, enemy soldiers killed 27 local leaders on that spot.       Old Town Square has several very old and giant churches. The churches are huge and their old, dark style is a little bit scary. One of the ancient buildings there is the old town hall building. Inside the building there’s a 600-year-old clock. The clock has beautiful religious carvings (宗教浮雕), and it still works. According to the story, the government hired a man to build the clock, and after the man was done, the government blinded him. Why? They didn’t want him to build a clock for anybody else!       Another famous part of Prague is the Jewish Quarter. In the past, Jewish people were forced to live in this area.Other parts of Prague have huge castles and churches. Those areas are beautiful, but they might not seem real to some people. In the Jewish Quarter, the streets are narrower and the buildings are smaller. It helps visitors understand how ordinary people lived hundreds of years ago. It also has a simple but very beautiful synagogue. A synagogue is a Jewish temple.       Here is another piece of advice for you, just in case you ever visit Prague. Try the beer.

They found that lunches packed at home were generally less nutritious (有营养的) than meals provided by schools.\n        School cafeterias (自助餐厅) in the United States must follow the rules set out by the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), a government service that provides low-cost or free lunches to students. The rules require schools to serve more fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products (乳制品). Schools must also limit the amounts of fat, salt and sugar in the food they serve.\n        The researchers found that none of the packed lunches they examined met all of the requirements on the NSLP list. Only 27 per cent of the packed lunches met at least three of the requirements. Ninety-five per cent of all the lunches did not contain a serving of vegetables. One in four lunches did not include a main food item. Instead, they contained packaged snacks and desserts. The researchers said they were surprised by the amount of sugary drinks and packaged foods — like potato chips, cookies and fruit snacks — they found in the lunches.\n        Since about 40 per cent of American school children bring their lunch, unhealthy food in their lunchboxes could have serious results. Serving nutritious food to children not only keeps them healthy and ready to learn, it also helps to develop good eating habits, and it can affect their future health.\n        Jeanne Goldberg, the professor who led the lunchbox study in Massachusetts, said the researchers recognize that parents have to consider the cost and convenience of lunch foods as well as what their children will actually eat. \n        “Unfortunately, these factors are not always in harmony with good nutrition,” she said.\n        Even if parents pack healthy lunches, there is no way to make sure their children eat them. Professor Goldberg said the study shows that it is necessary not only to help parents find lunch options (可选择的东西) that are convenient, affordable and healthy,but also to encourage children to choose those options.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p>本文是一篇说明文。马萨诸塞州的研究人员发现自带的盒饭不及学校餐厅提供的午餐营养全面。</p>","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":7633,\"main_id\":52338,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Compared with home-packed lunches, school lunches ________.\",\"answer\":\"B. are more nutritionally balanced\",\"answer_a\":\"A. are more expensive\\t\",\"answer_b\":\"B. are more nutritionally balanced\",\"answer_c\":\"C. provide a limited amount of fruit \",\"answer_d\":\"D. contain more packaged snacks and desserts\",\"highlight\":\"\",\"analysis\":\"<p>推理判断题 根据第三段最后两句可知学校餐厅要求食物包含水果、蔬菜、全麦、低脂乳制品等，且对食物 中所含有的脂肪、糖和盐都有一定的限制。而学生自带的午餐被检测出很多问题，因此学校餐厅的午餐营养 更为均衡。</p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"},{\"id\":7634,\"main_id\":52338,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What is paragraph 4 mainly about?\",\"answer\":\"B.

They found that lunches packed at home were generally less nutritious (有营养的) than meals provided by schools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; School cafeterias (自助餐厅) in the United States must follow the rules set out by the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), a government service that provides low-cost or free lunches to students. The rules require schools to serve more fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products (乳制品). Schools must also limit the amounts of fat, salt and sugar in the food they serve.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The researchers found that none of the packed lunches they examined met all of the requirements on the NSLP list. Only 27 per cent of the packed lunches met at least three of the requirements. Ninety-five per cent of all the lunches did not contain a serving of vegetables. One in four lunches did not include a main food item. Instead, they contained packaged snacks and desserts. The researchers said they were surprised by the amount of sugary drinks and packaged foods — like potato chips, cookies and fruit snacks — they found in the lunches.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since about 40 per cent of American school children bring their lunch, unhealthy food in their lunchboxes could have serious results. Serving nutritious food to children not only keeps them healthy and ready to learn, it also helps to develop good eating habits, and it can affect their future health.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jeanne Goldberg, the professor who led the lunchbox study in Massachusetts, said the researchers recognize that parents have to consider the cost and convenience of lunch foods as well as what their children will actually eat.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “Unfortunately, these factors are not always in harmony with good nutrition,” she said.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even if parents pack healthy lunches, there is no way to make sure their children eat them. Professor Goldberg said the study shows that it is necessary not only to help parents find lunch options (可选择的东西) that are convenient, affordable and healthy,but also to encourage children to choose those options.</p>"}],"description":"success","result_code":200}
