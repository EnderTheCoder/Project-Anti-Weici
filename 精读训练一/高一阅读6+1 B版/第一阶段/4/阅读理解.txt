题目:        In September 2004, tourist David Budzinski visited Kruger National Park in South Africa. The eight-minute video that he recorded became an Internet hit and has been viewed by millions of people all over the world.
        The video begins with a group of Cape buffalo (水牛) nearing a watering hole. Nearby, a group of lions wait, hiding from their prey. As soon as the lead buffalo spots the lions, it turns, and the chase (追赶) is on. The lions separate a small Cape buffalo calf from its mother and knock it into the water. The lions surround the calf and work slowly to pull it back out of the water. Before they are successful, however, a hungry crocodile comes by and takes hold of the calf’s back leg with its powerful jaws. Now the lions are trying to fight off the crocodile!
        It may sound like the poor calf was sure to die, but what happens next is the reason this video became popular and has had over 64 million hits since it was posted in 2007.
        As the lions and the crocodile are fighting over the calf, the other Cape buffaloes regroup and charge the lions! One buffalo throws a lion into the air with its large horns, and the others move with heavy steps and snort (哼) at the frightened lions. The calf, though injured, manages to stand up and return to its mother in the group. The angry Cape buffaloes then chase the lions away from the watering hole.
        The video of “The Battle at Kruger” is a powerful example of why you should never give up hope, even in the face of a seemingly hopeless situation.
