题目:        Nancy was out for a day hike (远足) in the mountains of Washington state in October when she first spotted a hiker in a red jacket heading north towards Canada without snowshoes. The hiker was named Katharina. She traveled from Munich ### to hike the entire 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail.
       Katharina and Nancy spent several hours ### while hiking side-by-side along the trail until they ### . Nancy, however, could not stop ### the German hiker, so she decided to check the daily ### along the trail from her home in Salta, Washington.
       Only a few days later, a ### rolled in. Concerned for her new friend, Nancy posted on a local hiker’s forum (论坛) asking if anyone had ### a German hiker heading north. Someone reported they had run into her two days previously — but ### had seen her since.
       Nancy couldn’t shake the feeling that Katharina was ### , so she called rescue services and told them about the ### hiker. Since she knew that Katharina had ### to hike 15 miles every day, she ### how far along the trail the German hiker would likely be based on the weather and how much she was ### .
       Sure enough, Katharina had ### down — to a pace of 7 miles per day. She was ### wet and showing signs of frostbite (冻伤). She was running out of food and her ### had lost service. Katharina was prepared for the worst — ### then suddenly, a rescue helicopter spotted her red jacket based on Nancy’s exact calculations. Katharina was ### .
       She was then ### to stay with Nancy at her home, where the two have become “Wild” friends, and even though Katharina didn’t ### the trail, she gained something more important — a friendship she would treasure forever!
