题目:        Every year in Australia, the strongest long-distance runners race more than 500 miles from Sydney to Melbourne. The race takes more than five days to complete. It attracts world-class athletes — the kind who become spokespeople for sneakers (运动鞋) and sports drinks.
        In 1983, however, as the competitors lined up to race, they were joined by a 61-year-old farmer wearing overalls (工装裤) and rubber boots. His name was Cliff Young. The other runners thought he was a confused viewer. Cliff made them believe that he was there to race. He explained that on his family’s sheep farm, he often had to round up 2,000 or so animals by himself. “Sometimes I had to run after those sheep for two or three days,” he said.
        When the race began, the younger runners flew past Cliff. Instead of running after them, Cliff shuffled (拖着脚走) along in an unusual way. The other runners and the viewers thought he would never finish the race. But that was not what happened. When all the other runners took a break to sleep, Cliff kept running. The other runners caught up with him each morning, but in the end Cliff was too far ahead to be passed. On the fifth day, the sheep farmer shuffled into first place.
        Cliff received $10,000 for winning the race. He said he did not realize there would be prize money, and he gave the money to his fellow runners. Doing this made him a hero in Australia. Since then, many runners have adopted his shuffling style. No one sleeps during the race anymore, either. The farmer changed long-distance racing and proved that age and style aren’t everything.
