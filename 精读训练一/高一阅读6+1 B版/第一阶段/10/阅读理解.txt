题目:       Lying in the North Atlantic Ocean, Iceland is Europe’s westernmost country, with the most northerly capital city in the world. Viking explorers moved here from northern Europe in 930 A.D. The country’s national language can still be traced (追溯) to the one spoken by the Vikings over 1,000 years ago. Despite its small size, there are many reasons to visit this country.       Most visitors’ first port of call (落脚点) is the country’s capital, Reykjavík, a small and clean city known for its colorful and stylish architecture. In 2000, Reykjavík was awarded the title of Europe’s City of Culture, thanks to its impressive art and museum scenes, and lively nightlife.       The good news for visitors is that Iceland’s temperatures are fairly mild (温和的), even in the winter when they stay at around four degrees. During winter months, nights are long. In summer, the country gets almost 22 hours of daylight, and native Icelanders and visitors alike enjoy partying outdoors until daybreak.       Iceland is one of the most volcanically active nations in the world, and there are a number of hot springs around the island. One of Iceland’s most popular hot springs is the Blue Lagoon, a huge lake of bright blue seawater just outside Reykjavík. Surrounded by volcanoes, the Blue Lagoon receives more than 300,000 visitors a year.        Most of the inner part of Iceland is reachable only by truck or other vehicles. Nevertheless, there is a series of outdoor activities to enjoy along the coasts. One of Iceland’s most popular attractions is caving. Exploring Iceland’s unusual lava (火山岩) caves, most of which formed more than 10,000 years ago, requires only basic caving knowledge and equipment. Ice caves, however, are more challenging and require special clothes and hiking tools. The best-known ice caves are in Vatnajökull.       And finally, no trip to Iceland would be complete without a visit to the Golden Circle. The mid-Atlantic fault (断 层) that runs through Iceland is pulling the island apart. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the Thingvellir Valley, where the land is actually separating and the stony ground under your feet frequently moves. Hold on while you hike!
