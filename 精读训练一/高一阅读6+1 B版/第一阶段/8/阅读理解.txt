What did Kids’ Fleet Parents from past years have to say about Kids’ Fleet Summer Day Camp? 
       “My son thought that the camp had just the right amount of activities to keep the children interested. The rock climbing, golfing, as well as the outdoor activities and swimming were perfect. He was very tired but in a good way. My son wants to return next year and I will recommend (推荐) this camp to others.”

— Kristin and Doug
