题目:        When Nora Gross was just four years old, she and her father passed a homeless man. Concerned about the cold winter weather, Gross asked, “Can we take him home?” Her question became the starting point of a project that has become one of the largest youth philanthropy (慈善行为) programs in the world.        Gross’s big idea was small coins. She knew that pennies often seem like worthless things. But she thought that if she and other students could gather enough of them, the money could really make a difference. This was the beginning of the Penny Harvest. Today, more than half a million students take part in the program. In its first 20 years, the Penny Harvest has collected $8.1 million in pennies!        Gross and her father founded Common Cents, a not-for-profit (非盈利的) organization, to manage their money collecting efforts. They believe the penny drives can help develop young people’s generosity and moral (道德的) character. After the pennies are collected, students form philanthropy roundtables to discuss community problems and to decide where to donate (捐) the collected money. Many students become inspired by the process and go on to become volunteers at the organizations they support, which include animal care facilities, community gardens, senior centers, and homeless shelters.        Teddy Gross explains: “We at Common Cents regard America’s billion-dollar resource (资源) of pennies — found in large quantities in the homes of both the rich and poor — as the philanthropic belongings of young people. For this reason, every penny the children collect is theirs to give away in an educational group process.” The students devoted to the Penny Harvest have changed the world for the better, and they have learned valuable lessons about caring for others in their communities.
