题目:        When researchers in the United States compared school lunches to home-packed lunches, parents got a failing grade.
        Researchers in Massachusetts inspected lunches belonging to about 600 grade three and four students at 12 different schools in the state. They found that lunches packed at home were generally less nutritious (有营养的) than meals provided by schools.
        School cafeterias (自助餐厅) in the United States must follow the rules set out by the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), a government service that provides low-cost or free lunches to students. The rules require schools to serve more fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products (乳制品). Schools must also limit the amounts of fat, salt and sugar in the food they serve.
        The researchers found that none of the packed lunches they examined met all of the requirements on the NSLP list. Only 27 per cent of the packed lunches met at least three of the requirements. Ninety-five per cent of all the lunches did not contain a serving of vegetables. One in four lunches did not include a main food item. Instead, they contained packaged snacks and desserts. The researchers said they were surprised by the amount of sugary drinks and packaged foods — like potato chips, cookies and fruit snacks — they found in the lunches.
        Since about 40 per cent of American school children bring their lunch, unhealthy food in their lunchboxes could have serious results. Serving nutritious food to children not only keeps them healthy and ready to learn, it also helps to develop good eating habits, and it can affect their future health.
        Jeanne Goldberg, the professor who led the lunchbox study in Massachusetts, said the researchers recognize that parents have to consider the cost and convenience of lunch foods as well as what their children will actually eat. 
        “Unfortunately, these factors are not always in harmony with good nutrition,” she said.
        Even if parents pack healthy lunches, there is no way to make sure their children eat them. Professor Goldberg said the study shows that it is necessary not only to help parents find lunch options (可选择的东西) that are convenient, affordable and healthy,but also to encourage children to choose those options.
