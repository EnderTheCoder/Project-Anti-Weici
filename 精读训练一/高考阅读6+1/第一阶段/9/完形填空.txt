题目:        I had stopped at a gas station the other day to fill up when I noticed a woman with two children standing outside her car. She seemed ### on her phone and appeared tearful. After I ### my tank, I walked by and ### if everything was OK. She explained to me that her car battery ### and the kids’ father was at work, and cannot be ###. I could have just expressed some sympathy and ###, but instead I mentioned that I had jumper cables (跨接线) and could give them a ###.

        Then, I went back to my car, ### next to her, connected the ### and while waiting for the charge, I gave her and the kids some ### I’d kept in the car ### the outside temperature was well over 100 degrees. I ### the air conditioner and invited them in the car to ###. I got her car to start and the young woman was so ### that she was in tears.
        She told me that since ### here from Nevada, no one had shown her the ### that she’d received today. I told her I was happy to help and that sometimes we all just need a little ### once in a while. The young woman wanted to get my contact (联系) information to try to ### me. I told her the best thing she could do was pay ### forward and not worry about any repayment. The kids gave me a big THANK YOU ###! And they were on their way.
