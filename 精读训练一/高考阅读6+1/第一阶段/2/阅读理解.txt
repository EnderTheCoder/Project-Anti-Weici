题目:      You may have heard of the book Moby Dick (《白鲸记》), written by the American author Herman Melville. You may also know that Moby Dick is considered one of the greatest novels ever written. However, it might surprise you to find out that Herman Melville was not always a highly regarded author.      Melville’s first two novels, Typee and Omoo, were widely read and financially successful. They were both exciting tales of adventures at sea and experiences with people in foreign lands. Melville became quite famous. However, upon the publication of his third book, Mardi, Melville’s popularity began to weaken. He was no longer interested in telling tales of pure adventure, and his writing took on a style that alienated (使疏远) the general reading public of his time.      Melville published Moby Dick in October of 1851. It was an original novel, combining aspects of sociology and philosophy, which confused readers by its complex symbolism. The book sold poorly.      Melville’s next book, Pierre, was almost completely disregarded by the public. Debt, frustration (沮丧), and ill health finally forced Melville to take a low-paying job as a customs inspector. Eventually, Melville abandoned prose (散文) and began to write poetry.      The Civil War is the main subject of Melville’s poetry. He and his brother made a trip to the front line, and he published a book of poems, Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War, based on this experience.      Melville died in 1891 at the age of seventy-two. At this point, his work had been completely forgotten by the public. His talent was to go unrecognized for the next thirty years. Then, in the 1920s, his reputation began to improve as critics and readers rediscovered his work. Today Moby Dick is one of the best-known novels ever penned by an American author.
