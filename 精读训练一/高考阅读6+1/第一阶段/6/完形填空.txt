题目:      My daughter is only two years old and, like most girls, already has a nurturing (培育) spirit growing inside of her. Everything that she has she tries to ###. She already has favorite suits, favorite toys, and even a favorite blanket.
      This blanket is a pink one that was purchased for her before she was born. It seems to be the one she ### the closest. I always see her dragging that blanket around from upstairs to downstairs, downstairs to upstairs. She sits and eats with it, tries to brush her teeth with it, and ### jumps right out of the bath to run to it. She won’t turn it ###! It gets washed many times in the course of a week yet it is almost always ###.
      Normally I just laugh at the thing but recently my daughter has had a cold. Any parent will tell you that germs (细菌) can get into the things the child has ### with and cause them to stay sick ### getting better. So, unwillingly, we ### the blanket out of my daughter’s daily life. Of course, she wasn’t ###. It was something she loved, ### was hers, and had established familiarity with. However, ### the blanket is gone, she has a better ### of getting over her cold faster and not getting sick again.
      She doesn’t know it but the ### is part of what was keeping her trapped in a state of sickness. We, as ###, know a lot of things that are keeping us from our true purpose, or even, true happiness. But we won’t let them ###. We have friends, habits, and guilty pleasures that keep us trapped in a state of sickness, disappointment, suffering or ###. We’d rather keep them ### because they are familiar. ### sometimes change is beautiful. ### our security blankets is a tall order but a ### step for us to grow.
