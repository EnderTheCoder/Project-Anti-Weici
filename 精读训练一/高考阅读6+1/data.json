The history of the peppered moth (桦尺蛾) is an example of the natural selection process.\n      In nineteenth-century England, certain types of peppered moths were able to better blend (融合) into their surroundings. During that time period, great changes were happening in Great Britain. The Industrial Revolution was part of this change, and with it came air pollution. Natural selection often takes hundreds or even thousands of years to occur. For the peppered moth, this process occurred comparatively quickly.\n      At the beginning of the Industrial Age, most peppered moths in England were light-colored and covered with black markings, although a few moths had dark-colored wings. Because the light-colored moths blended into the lightcolored bark on the trees, they could not be easily seen by birds that would eat them. As the air grew more polluted, however, tree trunks became covered with soot (煤烟) and became darker. The light-colored moths became easy for birds to see against the dark tree trunks. Since the dark-colored moths now had the advantage, their numbers grew.Within 50 years, the peppered moth went from being mostly light-colored to being mostly dark-colored.\n      In the twentieth century, the air cleared up, and the peppered moth population changed again. As tree trunks lightened due to less soot in the air, light-colored moths once again had an advantage. Their numbers increased as soot levels declined. Depending on their environment, the coloration of the moths helped them to be “naturally selected” to survive.

The history of the peppered moth (桦尺蛾) is an example of the natural selection process.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In nineteenth-century England, certain types of peppered moths were able to better blend (融合) into their surroundings. During that time period, great changes were happening in Great Britain. The Industrial Revolution was part of this change, and with it came air pollution. Natural selection often takes hundreds or even thousands of years to occur. For the peppered moth, this process occurred comparatively quickly.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the beginning of the Industrial Age, most peppered moths in England were light-colored and covered with black markings, although a few moths had dark-colored wings. Because the light-colored moths blended into the lightcolored bark on the trees, they could not be easily seen by birds that would eat them. As the air grew more polluted, however, tree trunks became covered with soot (煤烟) and became darker. The light-colored moths became easy for birds to see against the dark tree trunks. Since the dark-colored moths now had the advantage, their numbers grew.Within 50 years, the peppered moth went from being mostly light-colored to being mostly dark-colored.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the twentieth century, the air cleared up, and the peppered moth population changed again. As tree trunks lightened due to less soot in the air, light-colored moths once again had an advantage. Their numbers increased as soot levels declined. Depending on their environment, the coloration of the moths helped them to be “naturally selected” to survive.&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":51999,"word_id":0,"test_group":3,"check_point":3,"questions":0,"subject":"      Russian police have started a new attempt to get drivers to slow down at zebra crossings by having painted horses as zebras walk across on the busiest streets in some of the big cities in an attempt to improve road safety and raise awareness among Russia’s notoriously (臭名昭著地) careless drivers.      The light grey horses, painted with black stripes (条纹), carried signs on their backs reading: “Careful, children are on their way to school.” The police sent the “zebras” to several different locations in the Russian capital, where officials in orange vests (背心) walked them over zebra crossings and handed out leaflets (传单) to passing drivers.

She had a student who finished his work before all the others and needed a challenge. “Could he help in the library?” She asked. I said, “Send him along.”        Soon a slight, sandy-haired boy in jeans and a T-shirt appeared. “Do you have a job for me?” he asked.         I told him about the Dewey Decimal System (杜威十进分类法) for shelving books. He picked up the idea immediately. Then I showed him a stack (摞) of cards for long-overdue books that had actually been returned but were misshelved with the wrong cards in them. He said, “Is it kind of a detective job?” I answered yes, and he began working.         He had found three books with wrong cards by the time his teacher opened the door and announced, “Time for break!” He argued for finishing the finding job; she made the case for fresh air. She won.         The next morning, he arrived early. “I want to finish these books,” he said. At the end of the day, when he asked to be a librarian on a regular basis, it was easy to say yes. He worked untiringly.        After a few weeks I found a note on my desk, inviting me to dinner at the boy’s home. At the end of a pleasant evening, his mother announced that the family would be moving to a neighbouring school district. Her son’s first concern, she said, was leaving the View Ridge library. “Who will find the lost books?” he asked.        When the time came, I said an unwilling good-bye. I missed him, but not for long. A few days later he came back and joyfully announced, “The librarian over there doesn’t let boys work in the library. My mother got me transferred back to View Ridge. My dad will drop me off on his way to work. And if he can’t, I’ll walk!”        I should have had an idea such focused determination would take that young man wherever he wanted to go.

I said, “Send him along.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Soon a slight, sandy-haired boy in jeans and a T-shirt appeared. “Do you have a job for me?” he asked.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I told him about the Dewey Decimal System (杜威十进分类法) for shelving books. He picked up the idea immediately. Then I showed him a stack (摞) of cards for long-overdue books that had actually been returned but were misshelved with the wrong cards in them. He said, “Is it kind of a detective job?” I answered yes, and he began working.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had found three books with wrong cards by the time his teacher opened the door and announced, “Time for break!” He argued for finishing the finding job; she made the case for fresh air. She won.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next morning, he arrived early. “I want to finish these books,” he said.

He worked untiringly.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After a few weeks I found a note on my desk, inviting me to dinner at the boy’s home. At the end of a pleasant evening, his mother announced that the family would be moving to a neighbouring school district.

I missed him, but not for long. A few days later he came back and joyfully announced, “The librarian over there doesn’t let boys work in the library. My mother got me transferred back to View Ridge.

       Philo Farnsworth was a man who made it possible for one of the most important communication devices — television to be created. Philo was born on August 19th, 1906, near Indian Creek in the western state of Utah. He attended a very small school near his family’s farm. He did very well in school. He asked his teacher for special help in science. The teacher began helping Philo learn a great deal more than most young students could understand.        One night, Philo read a magazine story about the idea of sending pictures and sound through the air. Anyone with a device that could receive this electronic information could watch the pictures and hear the sound. The magazine story said some of the world’s best scientists were using special machines to try to make a kind of device to send pictures.        14-year-old Philo decided these famous scientists were wrong and that mechanical devices would never work. He decided that such a device would have to be electronic. Philo knew electrons (电子) could be made to move extremely fast. All he would have to do was to find a way to make electrons do the work.        Very quickly Philo had an idea for such a receiver. It would trap light in a container and send the light on a line of electrons. Philo called it “light in a bottle”.        Several days later, Philo told his teacher about a device that could capture (捕捉) pictures. He drew a plan for it, which he gave his teacher. Philo’s drawing seemed very simple, but it clearly showed the information needed to build a television. In fact, all television equipment today still uses Philo’s early idea.        Philo Farnsworth was only 14 years old then. He knew no one would listen to a child. In fact, experts say that probably only ten scientists in the world at that time could have understood his idea.        On September 7th, 1927, Philo turned on a device that was the first working television receiver. The image produced on the receiver was not very clear, but the device worked.
