The participants completed interviews and medical tests every two years between 1990 and 2009.\n        The researchers did not include any grandparents who were the primary caregivers for their grandchildren, only those who cared for grandchildren from time to time.

Half of the grandparents who cared for grandchildren were still alive ten years after the initial interview.

In contrast, about half of the participants who did not help others died within five years of the start of the study.\n        “Caregiving may give caregivers a purpose of life because caregivers may feel useful for others and for the society,” said Bruno Arpino, an associate professor at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain who was not involved in the study.\n        “Caregiving may be thought also as an activity that keeps caregivers physically and mentally active,” Professor Arpino said, adding that previous studies suggest that caregiving may improve cognitive (认知的) functioning, mental and physical health.\n        Arpino noted, however, that caregiving is not the only activity that can improve health, and too many caring responsibilities can take away from other beneficial activities like working, being in social clubs, or volunteering.\n        “Children should take into consideration their parents’ needs, willingness, and desires and agree with them on the timing and amount of childcare,” Arpino suggested.","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p>&nbsp;本文是一篇说明文。研究发现老年人有时给子女或他人提供帮助和支持可以延长寿命。</p>","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":7301,\"main_id\":52303,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What can we know from the text?\",\"answer\":\"A.

       On September 11, 2016, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, eight athletes from six countries ran toward the finish line. They are competing in the first-ever women’s paratriathlon, a three race event in the Paralympic Games (国际残疾人奥运会). They have completed the 750-meter swim and the 20-kilometer bicycle race. Now they are closing in on the finish, the end of the 5-kilometer run.\n        Melissa Stockwell, whose left leg was amputated (截肢) above the knee, is one of the front-runners. With a burst of energy, she crosses the line, winning a bronze medal.\n        Growing up in Michigan, Georgia, and Minnesota, Melissa was a talented gymnast. In 2002, Melissa graduated from the University of Colorado and was commissioned (任命) as a Second Lieutenant (中尉) in the United States\nArmy. In March 2004, an explosion caused the loss of her left leg above the knee. Following her military career, athletics become a way of life for Melissa.\n        Melissa’s mother recalls her daughter’s attitude as she regained strength through swimming. “Seeing so many patients with injuries far worse than hers, she realized that she was lucky to have the chance to live a life again and became more determined to live in honor of those soldiers who would not.”\n        One day, Melissa saw a presentation about the Paralympic Games. Inspired, she increased her swimming to a competitive level. Although she was considered a long shot, Melissa made the 2008 USA Paralympic Team and\nrepresented her country in Beijing, China.\n        After the 2008 Olympics, Melissa was invited to try paratriathlon. She loved the challenge. She trained and went on to win the International Triathlon Union Paralympic World Championships in 2010, 2011, and 2012. She won many championships. She counts her 2016 bronze-medal as one of the best moments of her life.\n        Today, Melissa keeps training and gives inspirational talks based on her experiences. “Don’t take no for an answer,” she says. “Continue to believe in yourself and find a way to succeed.”","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"<p>&nbsp;本文是一篇记叙文。军旅生涯中的一次意外使得Melissa Stockwell的左腿从膝盖以上部分被截肢。后来她开始游泳，2008年参加了北京奥运会，此后她又连续三年参加了残疾人铁人三项运动，并都赢得冠军。2016年，她在里约奥运会上收获一枚铜牌。</p>","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":7393,\"main_id\":52314,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Which of the following sports did Melissa do before her military career?\",\"answer\":\"C.

They are competing in the first-ever women’s paratriathlon, a three race event in the Paralympic Games (国际残疾人奥运会). They have completed the 750-meter swim and the 20-kilometer bicycle race. Now they are closing in on the finish, the end of the 5-kilometer run.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa Stockwell, whose left leg was amputated (截肢) above the knee, is one of the front-runners. With a burst of energy, she crosses the line, winning a bronze medal.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing up in Michigan, Georgia, and Minnesota, Melissa was a talented gymnast. In 2002, Melissa graduated from the University of Colorado and was commissioned (任命) as a Second Lieutenant (中尉) in the United States<br/>Army. In March 2004, an explosion caused the loss of her left leg above the knee. Following her military career, athletics become a way of life for Melissa.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa’s mother recalls her daughter’s attitude as she regained strength through swimming. “Seeing so many patients with injuries far worse than hers, she realized that she was lucky to have the chance to live a life again and became more determined to live in honor of those soldiers who would not.”<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, Melissa saw a presentation about the Paralympic Games. Inspired, she increased her swimming to a competitive level. Although she was considered a long shot, Melissa made the 2008 USA Paralympic Team and<br/>represented her country in Beijing, China.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the 2008 Olympics, Melissa was invited to try paratriathlon. She loved the challenge. She trained and went on to win the International Triathlon Union Paralympic World Championships in 2010, 2011, and 2012. She won many championships. She counts her 2016 bronze-medal as one of the best moments of her life.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Melissa keeps training and gives inspirational talks based on her experiences. “Don’t take no for an answer,” she says. “Continue to believe in yourself and find a way to succeed.”</p>"},{"id":52315,"word_id":0,"test_group":3,"check_point":3,"questions":0,"subject":"        A new computer program is being praised as a life-changer for blind people. The new program is known as the KNFB Reader app. It can help users listen to an audio (声音的) read-back — the sound — of printed material.        The application software program costs $99. It is the product of a long relationship between the National Federation of the Blind and Ray Kurzweil, a computer scientist and an employee of Google.        The KNFB Reader makes use of new pattern recognition and image-processing technology, and new hardware for smartphones. People using the app can adjust, or change the position of the camera and read printed materials out loud.        Mr Kurzweil started working on what he called “reading machines” in the early 1970s. The idea came after speaking with a blind person who expressed frustrations with the lack of technology to help blind people. His first reading machine was the size of a washing machine. It cost $50,000. The technology has continued to improve over the past 20 years. The new smartphone app can recognize and take printed material in one language and change it to another language. But it was not available on a mobile device until now. In the past, it cost more than $1,000 to use the software app with a camera and a mobile phone.        Blind people say the app will make life much easier and it will help with everything from reading restaurant menus to studying papers in the classroom.

Yes, it may taste good to some people, but the truth is, it is terrible for health. For those who live in a fast food fantasy world, eating it every day, believing that it is fast, convenient and inexpensive, it can be catastrophic (灾难性的).\n        Contrary to being cheap, fast food is very expensive on many levels. To start with, a home-cooked nutritious meal would cost a lot less than any fast food meal and you would know exactly what ingredients were in your food.\n        However, the expense is not only in terms of the money you spend at the restaurant. There are hidden costs. Not only does it cost money to pay for the petrol to go and get this nutritionally poor food, but also it is very wasteful of paper, plastic and styrene (苯乙烯) all of which do serious damage to the environment: plastic and styrene cannot be got rid of, but break up into small particles (颗粒) and end up in our water supply or our air, and therefore our food chain. It is a very severe circle.\n        Besides not being good for you, fast food is also addictive. The more you eat, the more you want, and so, more and more kids are suffering from fatness. Fast food restaurants have become a favourite hangout for teens, and not just for something to eat.

To start with, a home-cooked nutritious meal would cost a lot less than any fast food meal and you would know exactly what ingredients were in your food.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the expense is not only in terms of the money you spend at the restaurant. There are hidden costs. Not only does it cost money to pay for the petrol to go and get this nutritionally poor food, but also it is very wasteful of paper, plastic and styrene (苯乙烯) all of which do serious damage to the environment: plastic and styrene cannot be got rid of, but break up into small particles (颗粒) and end up in our water supply or our air, and therefore our food chain. It is a very severe circle.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides not being good for you, fast food is also addictive.
