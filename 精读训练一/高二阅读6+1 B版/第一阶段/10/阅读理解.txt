题目:        I love Ping-Pong. My family had a table in the basement when I was a kid, and now my own house has a Ping-Pong room instead of a dining room.
        But while I may be prejudiced, I’m also not alone. Ping-Pong, or table tennis, is played by some 300 millionpeople worldwide, according to the International Table Tennis Federation, making it one of Earth’s most popular sports. It has been an Olympic sport since 1988, and its US status has raised in recent years as a result of the rise of trendy Ping-Pong hangouts like New York’s SPiN and Portland’s Pips & Bounce.
        It’s not hard to see why. Ping-Pong is accessible for beginners, has relatively low injury risk, and works as a bar game or strong test of wills. And in spite of long being downgraded to garages and basements, Ping-Pong is also
increasingly billed as a “brain sport”, featuring a mix of strategy, quickness and coordination (协调能力).
        “There is a lot going on in table tennis,” says Wendy Suzuki, a professor at New York University and author of Healthy Brain, Happy Life, a new book exploring how physical exercise can affect the human brain. “Attention is increasing, memory is increasing, and you have a better mood. You’re building motor circuits in your brain. A bigger part of your brain is being activated.” Of course, Ping-Pong is only one path to the mental benefits of exercise, Suzuki adds. Many people prefer simpler activities like walking and running, for example, or larger-scale sports like tennis.
        Still, Ping-Pong has a certain magic power that’s hard to copy. Its small playing area tends to speed up the action, encouraging players to think and move at a fast pace. It’s a game of strategy, too, like high-speed chess without chairs. And not only can it perfect a broader fitness regimen (养生之道), but it’s also a gateway sport, pretending to be as mindless fun until it gets our brains — and bodies — hooked on (迷上) speed.
