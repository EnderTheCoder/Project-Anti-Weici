题目:        When I lived in Ireland five years ago, part of my college course was to work in the area of children with special needs. I was ### to work in a school with 5- to 16-year-old children with ### disabilities. They had no speech and most were in wheelchairs. Their ### asked if I would work with a 15-year-old girl who had the most serious disabilities in the class. All the teachers ### that making her zip up (拉上……的拉链) her own coat would be a great ### . But I saw more in her. She had ### wanted to put string through shaped blocks to make a necklace. For the five years she was in the school, the teachers always ### to help her but always ended up doing all the work for her. They thought the girl was so ### .
        But I had a different ### from her teachers. I knew this smart girl could do more, so I ### her. She had a thumb she couldn’t ### but I encouraged her so much to try. She got very ### at first and sometimes I wanted to shout at her but I didn’t. ### after a week this young girl was able to do what she had been ### to do by herself for so many years. Her teacher ### when she saw what this girl was able to do.
        People with disabilities should never be ### that they can’t. We are all humans and with just some encouragement we can do it. The look on that girl’s face ### she was able to do it herself ### the world to me. I ### everyone would encourage other people instead of telling them they cannot or ### it for them.
