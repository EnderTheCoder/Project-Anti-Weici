题目:        Parents and grandparents are understandably proud of the quick minds and impressive talents of their little ones. But let me tell you about another ### , perhaps even more important, found in a little girl named Skylar.
        I received a ### from a grandmother who told me about her four-year-old granddaughter Skylar. Ever since Skylar ### of Disneyland from TV, she ### her pocket money in a piggy bank to ### it someday. Her parents ### her with a trip when she was four, however, and didn’t even ### her to use her own money!
        When Skylar ### it was Christmas time. She wanted to buy ### with her savings. But she also learned from announcements on TV about a local homeless shelter called “The Road House”. She repeatedly asked her mother what “homeless” meant and why those children ### coats and warm clothes. She couldn’t seem to get her ### off the homeless.
        Her mother took her to the store to buy presents. ### buying for herself or her family, however, she ### to buy a warm coat, socks and gloves for a little girl in the shelter. She also wanted to buy a doll, but when she ### she didn’t have enough money, she ### the doll.
        When Skylar got home, she ### one of her favorite dolls and put it into the box with the other items she bought that day. She could ### wait for Christmas! Skylar was thinking about going to the shelter and giving her ### gifts to a homeless child. She was much filled with joy at truly ### someone else.
        “Perhaps it’s good to have a beautiful mind, but an even greater gift is to have a beautiful ### ,” says Nobel Laureate John Hash. “It is that one quality, above all else, that makes beautiful people.”
