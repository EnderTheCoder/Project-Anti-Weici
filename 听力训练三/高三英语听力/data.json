I’d never gone diving in open water before, like a river or a lake. And I had always been expecting a real sea dive. I’d just done my diving training in a pool. I was really looking forward to my first real sea dive. We couldn’t decide where to go at first. We considered going somewhere in Indonesia or in Australia, but then friends in the USA offered to let us stay with them, so we went to the coast there, where there were perfect diving conditions.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was a bit worried as we were swimming around because we’d heard there might be sharks in the area — only small ones, but it didn’t matter! So I was very scared when some big sea animals came swimming toward us — but they turned out to be whales! They played with us in the water. We even managed to get some photos. We hoped we’d see some flying fish — but no such luck.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each day’s dives were completely different. We did three dives on the first day, and four on the second, plus a few more on the third — twelve dives altogether!

I work with game developers and designers to think of good stories, and I write all the dialogue in the game by myself. When I was in secondary school, I never imagined that I would do this job! I played the violin and that was what I planned to do as my job. But I had an accident when I was playing basketball and hurt my hand, so I had to think of doing something else. My mother wanted me to be a journalist, but I didn’t think it was for me. <br/>&nbsp;I didn’t know what to study at university. I was good at lots of science subjects, including Physics and Maths, but I also loved entertaining people and I was good at Art. In the end I went to a film school where I studied lighting, special effects, how to use a camera ... all that! It was there that I started to think about working in the video game industry.<br/>&nbsp;People also ask me what I like best about being a video game writer. Well, the money is good and it’s quite exciting. Just last night, for example, I was at a big dinner where they were giving prizes for new games. But what I love most is the fact that I get on so well with everyone in the company. That’s what makes my job so much fun.</p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"}]","chinese":"","delete":0,"image_content":"[{\"id\":0,\"pid\":-1,\"text\":\"网络图\",\"show_text\":\"网络图\"}]","answer_e":"","answer_f":"","answer_g":"","answer_h":"","subject_edit":""},{"id":56134,"word_id":0,"test_group":2,"check_point":2,"questions":0,"subject":"高三试题 23 - Text 1_AAC.aac","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":9243,\"main_id\":56134,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What does the man often do on the weekend?\",\"answer\":\"B.

One of the things that concern me most is the future of the Alaska environment. About twenty years ago, before going on some wilderness research, I visited Anchorage, the largest city in Alaska. It was a small city of 40,000 people surrounded by a quiet wilderness. When I made a recent trip there, I found amazing changes. Anchorage now has a hundred and eight thousand people, more than four times as many as in 1960. There’re tall buildings, shopping centers and all the crowds and traffic jams. The forests and mountains are still nearby, but they seem so small compared to the city’s great size. The discovery of oil in Alaska brought increased wealth to the state. However, there have been too many people moving to Alaska in a very short period to work on the pipeline. There is not enough housing or transportation.&nbsp; <br/>&nbsp;I think Alaska must make important decisions soon. Alaskans need to decide how to develop their natural resources and mineral wealth without destroying the wilderness and harming the wildlife. What is decided on now will affect the generations to come. <br/>&nbsp;For today’s lecture, I’ve brought along many of the pictures I usually show in my environmental science classes in my own university. First, I’ll show you some pictures of Alaska’s wilderness as it is today. Then I’d like to outline my specific suggestions.</p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"}]","chinese":"","delete":0,"image_content":"[{\"id\":0,\"pid\":-1,\"text\":\"网络图\",\"show_text\":\"网络图\"}]","answer_e":"","answer_f":"","answer_g":"","answer_h":"","subject_edit":""},{"id":56173,"word_id":0,"test_group":2,"check_point":2,"questions":0,"subject":"高三试题 24 - Text 1_AAC.aac","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":9287,\"main_id\":56173,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"Who does the woman suggest go to the meeting tomorrow?\",\"answer\":\"A.

How Hollywood became a name for American film industry is a strange story.<br/>&nbsp;There was a village in southern California called Cahuenga Valley and Mr. and Mrs. Wilcox lived there. In 1887, Mrs. Wilcox met a stranger on a trip, who had a home called Hollywood. Mrs. Wilcox liked the name so much that she gave her home the same name. Because the Wilcox’s home was the biggest in Cahuenga Valley, the village soon became known as Hollywood. <br/>&nbsp;Between 1908 and 1913, many small independent film companies began moving to southern California. They were attracted by the sunny climate, which let them film throughout the year without the need for expensive lighting. And they wanted to get away from New York where they had problems with the larger, more powerful companies.<br/>&nbsp;When the only one studio was set up in Hollywood, the local people were very angry. So a law was passed forbidding the building of any more companies. Anyway, by 1915, “Hollywood” had become famous for its film industry.</p>\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"spell_word\":\"\"}]","chinese":"","delete":0,"image_content":"[{\"id\":0,\"pid\":-1,\"text\":\"网络图\",\"show_text\":\"网络图\"}]","answer_e":"","answer_f":"","answer_g":"","answer_h":"","subject_edit":""},{"id":56221,"word_id":0,"test_group":2,"check_point":2,"questions":0,"subject":"高三试题 25 - Text 1_AAC.aac","image_url":"","answer":"","answer_a":"","answer_b":"","answer_c":"","answer_d":"","highlight":"","spell_word":"","analysis":"","source":"","sub":"[{\"id\":9341,\"main_id\":56221,\"questions\":1,\"subject\":\"What does the woman’s mother look like?\",\"answer\":\"C.
