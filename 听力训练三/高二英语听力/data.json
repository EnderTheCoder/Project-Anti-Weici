There’s quite a lot of theory, but it’s all done through musical examples, so it’s practical at the same time.</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">W: Do you have a course book?</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">M: No, we don’t use one. We’re given a software programme called NotaAbilityLite and what it does is it presents what we write, the music we write, really clearly. We can write our own music, quite complex stuff for various instruments, and the programme plays it back to us. So it means that your computer is actually your own musical instrument!</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">W: So I do need my own computer, obviously.</p><p style=\\\"white-space: normal;\\\">M: Yes.
